Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\u000afive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow so? How can it affect them?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d replied his wife, \u201chow can you be so tiresome! You\u000amust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs that his design in settling here?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDesign! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\u000a_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\u000asoon as he comes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\u000athem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\u000aas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the\u000aparty.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\u000aI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\u000agrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\u000athe neighbourhood.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\u000abe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to\u000ago, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no\u000anewcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to\u000avisit him if you do not.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\u000aglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\u000ahearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though\u000aI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\u000aothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\u000agood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have none of them much to recommend them,\u201d replied he; \u201cthey are\u000aall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\u000aquickness than her sisters.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You\u000atake delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\u000aare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\u000athese last twenty years at least.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh, you do not know what I suffer.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\u000athousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\u000avisit them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\u000aall.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\u000areserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\u000abeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\u000awas less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,\u000alittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,\u000ashe fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\u000adaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 2\u000a\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\u000ahad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring\u000ahis wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\u000apaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\u000amanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\u000asuddenly addressed her with:\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her mother\u000aresentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him at the\u000aassemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\u000aof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\u000aof her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo more have I,\u201d said Mr. Bennet; \u201cand I am glad to find that you do\u000anot depend on her serving you.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain\u000aherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\u2019s sake! Have a little\u000acompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cKitty has no discretion in her coughs,\u201d said her father; \u201cshe times\u000athem ill.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not cough for my own amusement,\u201d replied Kitty fretfully. \u201cWhen is\u000ayour next ball to be, Lizzy?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo-morrow fortnight.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAye, so it is,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cand Mrs. Long does not come back\u000atill the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,\u000afor she will not know him herself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\u000aMr. Bingley to _her_.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cImpossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\u000amyself; how can you be so teasing?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI honour your circumspection. A fortnight\u2019s acquaintance is certainly\u000avery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\u000afortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,\u000aMrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as\u000ashe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will\u000atake it on myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \u201cNonsense,\u000anonsense!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\u201d cried he. \u201cDo\u000ayou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\u000athem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\u000aMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\u000agreat books and make extracts.\u201d\u000a\u000aMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile Mary is adjusting her ideas,\u201d he continued, \u201clet us return to Mr.\u000aBingley.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sick of Mr. Bingley,\u201d cried his wife.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If\u000aI had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called\u000aon him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\u000acannot escape the acquaintance now.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.\u000aBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy\u000awas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\u000awhile.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\u000apersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\u000aneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a\u000agood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a\u000aword about it till now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\u201d said Mr. Bennet; and,\u000aas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat an excellent father you have, girls!\u201d said she, when the door was\u000ashut. \u201cI do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\u000aor me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so\u000apleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\u000afor your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\u000athe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\u000aball.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!\u201d said Lydia stoutly, \u201cI am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\u000ayoungest, I\u2019m the tallest.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\u000areturn Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\u000adinner.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 3\u000a\u000a\u000aNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\u000adaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her\u000ahusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\u000ain various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\u000adistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at\u000alast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\u000aLady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\u000adelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\u000aagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\u000awith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\u000adancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\u000ahopes of Mr. Bingley\u2019s heart were entertained.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\u201d\u000a said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \u201cand all the others equally well\u000amarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and sat about\u000aten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\u000aadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had\u000aheard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\u000afortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper\u000awindow that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.\u000a\u000aAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already\u000ahad Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\u000ahousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\u000awas obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable\u000ato accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\u000adisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\u000aso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\u000ahe might be always flying about from one place to another, and never\u000asettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears\u000aa little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get\u000aa large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley\u000awas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.\u000aThe girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the\u000aday before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only\u000asix with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when\u000athe party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five\u000aaltogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and\u000aanother young man.\u000a\u000aMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\u000acountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\u000awith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\u000alooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\u000aof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\u000athe report which was in general circulation within five minutes\u000aafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\u000apronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he\u000awas much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\u000aadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\u000awhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\u000aproud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all\u000ahis large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\u000aforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared\u000awith his friend.\u000a\u000aMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\u000apeople in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\u000awas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving\u000aone himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\u000athemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\u000aonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\u000aintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\u000awalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\u000aHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\u000ain the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\u000aAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\u000ahis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\u000ahaving slighted one of her daughters.\u000a\u000aElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\u000adown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\u000astanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.\u000aBingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend\u000ato join it.\u000a\u000a\u201cCome, Darcy,\u201d said he, \u201cI must have you dance. I hate to see you\u000astanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\u000adance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\u000aparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this\u000ait would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\u000aanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\u000astand up with.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI would not be so fastidious as you are,\u201d cried Mr. Bingley, \u201cfor a\u000akingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in\u000amy life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\u000auncommonly pretty.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\u201d said Mr.\u000aDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\u000aof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\u000adare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhich do you mean?\u201d and turning round he looked for a moment at\u000aElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:\u000a\u201cShe is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no\u000ahumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\u000aby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\u000asmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\u000aremained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,\u000ahowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\u000aplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\u000a\u000aThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\u000aBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\u000aparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\u000adistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as\u000aher mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\u2019s\u000apleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\u000aaccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\u000afortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they\u000ahad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\u000aspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\u000awere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With\u000aa book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\u000agood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\u000asuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife\u2019s views on\u000athe stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a\u000adifferent story to hear.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d as she entered the room, \u201cwe have had a most\u000adelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\u000aJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\u000ashe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\u000aher twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her\u000atwice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\u000atime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\u000aup with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\u000acan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\u000adown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\u000aasked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,\u000aand the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,\u000aand the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf he had had any compassion for _me_,\u201d cried her husband impatiently,\u000a\u201che would not have danced half so much! For God\u2019s sake, say no more of\u000ahis partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\u000ahandsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw\u000aanything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.\u000aHurst\u2019s gown--\u201d\u000a\u000aHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\u000adescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\u000aof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\u000aexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I can assure you,\u201d she added, \u201cthat Lizzy does not lose much by not\u000asuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\u000aall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring\u000ahim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\u000agreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\u000adear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 4\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\u000aher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very\u000amuch she admired him.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is just what a young man ought to be,\u201d said she, \u201csensible,\u000agood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much\u000aease, with such perfect good breeding!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is also handsome,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cwhich a young man ought\u000alikewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\u000adid not expect such a compliment.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between\u000aus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\u000acould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\u000aseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman\u000ain the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\u000avery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\u000astupider person.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDear Lizzy!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\u000aYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\u000ain your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your\u000alife.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\u000awhat I think.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\u000agood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\u000aothers! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it\u000aeverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the\u000agood of everybody\u2019s character and make it still better, and say nothing\u000aof the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man\u2019s sisters,\u000atoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCertainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you\u000aconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\u000ahis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\u000aneighbour in her.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at\u000athe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\u000aquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,\u000aand with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she\u000awas very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine\u000aladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the\u000apower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\u000aconceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the\u000afirst private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\u000apounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of\u000aassociating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect\u000aentitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of\u000aa respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\u000aimpressed on their memories than that their brother\u2019s fortune and their\u000aown had been acquired by trade.\u000a\u000aMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\u000athousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\u000aestate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\u000asometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a\u000agood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\u000awho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\u000aremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\u000apurchase.\u000a\u000aHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,\u000athough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\u000ameans unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\u000amarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\u000ahis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\u000aage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation\u000ato look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for\u000ahalf-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal\u000arooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it\u000aimmediately.\u000a\u000aBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of\u000agreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\u000aeasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\u000acould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\u000anever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy\u2019s regard, Bingley\u000ahad the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.\u000aIn understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\u000adeficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\u000areserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not\u000ainviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\u000awas sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\u000agiving offense.\u000a\u000aThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\u000acharacteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or\u000aprettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive\u000ato him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt\u000aacquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not\u000aconceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a\u000acollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for\u000anone of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received\u000aeither attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\u000abut she smiled too much.\u000a\u000aMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired\u000aher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one\u000awhom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\u000aestablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such\u000acommendation to think of her as he chose.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 5\u000a\u000a\u000aWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\u000awere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\u000ain Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\u000ahonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.\u000aThe distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a\u000adisgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;\u000aand, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house\u000aabout a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,\u000awhere he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,\u000aunshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all\u000athe world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\u000asupercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By\u000anature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.\u000aJames\u2019s had made him courteous.\u000a\u000aLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\u000avaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\u000aof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\u000aElizabeth\u2019s intimate friend.\u000a\u000aThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over\u000aa ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\u000abrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\u000a\u000a\u201c_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet with civil\u000aself-command to Miss Lucas. \u201c_You_ were Mr. Bingley\u2019s first choice.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; but he seemed to like his second better.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\u000asure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he\u000a_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\u000aabout Mr. Robinson.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not\u000aI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson\u2019s asking him how he liked our Meryton\u000aassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many\u000apretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\u000aanswering immediately to the last question: \u2018Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,\u000abeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUpon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as\u000aif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,\u201d said\u000aCharlotte. \u201cMr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\u000ais he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI beg you would not put it into Lizzy\u2019s head to be vexed by his\u000aill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite\u000aa misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\u000asat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you quite sure, ma\u2019am?--is not there a little mistake?\u201d said Jane.\u000a\u201cI certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\u000acould not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at\u000abeing spoke to.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Bingley told me,\u201d said Jane, \u201cthat he never speaks much,\u000aunless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably\u000aagreeable.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\u000aagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\u000awas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\u000aheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to\u000athe ball in a hack chaise.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\u201d said Miss Lucas, \u201cbut I\u000awish he had danced with Eliza.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnother time, Lizzy,\u201d said her mother, \u201cI would not dance with _him_,\u000aif I were you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe, ma\u2019am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHis pride,\u201d said Miss Lucas, \u201cdoes not offend _me_ so much as pride\u000aoften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\u000avery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\u000ashould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\u000ato be proud.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is very true,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cand I could easily forgive\u000a_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPride,\u201d observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\u000areflections, \u201cis a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\u000aever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\u000anature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\u000awho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\u000aquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\u000athings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may\u000abe proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\u000aourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\u201d cried a young Lucas, who came with\u000ahis sisters, \u201cI should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\u000afoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\u201d said Mrs.\u000aBennet; \u201cand if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\u000adirectly.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\u000awould, and the argument ended only with the visit.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 6\u000a\u000a\u000aThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\u000awas soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet\u2019s pleasing manners grew on\u000athe goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\u000afound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\u000aa wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards\u000athe two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest\u000apleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment\u000aof everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\u000athough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\u000aall probability from the influence of their brother\u2019s admiration. It\u000awas generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and\u000ato _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\u000awhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\u000away to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\u000awas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\u000aunited, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\u000auniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions\u000aof the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt may perhaps be pleasant,\u201d replied Charlotte, \u201cto be able to impose\u000aon the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\u000aso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\u000afrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\u000ait will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in\u000athe dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\u000aattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\u000a_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\u000avery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\u000aencouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_\u000aaffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\u000amay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can\u000aperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to\u000adiscover it too.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cRemember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\u2019s disposition as you do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\u000ait, he must find it out.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane\u000ameet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they\u000aalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\u000aevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\u000atherefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his\u000aattention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for\u000afalling in love as much as she chooses.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour plan is a good one,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cwhere nothing is in\u000aquestion but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined\u000ato get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\u000athese are not Jane\u2019s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,\u000ashe cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its\u000areasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\u000adances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\u000aand has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite\u000aenough to make her understand his character.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\u000aonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\u000aremember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four\u000aevenings may do a great deal.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they\u000aboth like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other\u000aleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell,\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cI wish Jane success with all my heart; and\u000aif she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\u000achance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\u000atwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\u000athe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or\u000aever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\u000aleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\u000ahave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\u000apossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\u000alife.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\u000asound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\u201d\u000a\u000aOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\u2019s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth\u000awas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\u000ainterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\u000aallowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\u000aball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\u000asooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly\u000ahad a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\u000auncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\u000athis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\u000adetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\u000ain her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\u000apleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\u000aof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\u000athis she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made\u000ahimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\u000ato dance with.\u000a\u000aHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing\u000awith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\u000adrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas\u2019s, where a large party were\u000aassembled.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat does Mr. Darcy mean,\u201d said she to Charlotte, \u201cby listening to my\u000aconversation with Colonel Forster?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see\u000awhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\u000abeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\u000aany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\u000aa subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\u000aturned to him and said:\u000a\u000a\u201cDid you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\u000awell just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\u000aMeryton?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\u000aenergetic.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are severe on us.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,\u201d said Miss Lucas. \u201cI am going\u000ato open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\u000ato play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken\u000aa musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\u000areally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\u000ahearing the very best performers.\u201d On Miss Lucas\u2019s persevering, however,\u000ashe added, \u201cVery well, if it must be so, it must.\u201d And gravely glancing\u000aat Mr. Darcy, \u201cThere is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\u000acourse familiar with: \u2018Keep your breath to cool your porridge\u2019; and I\u000ashall keep mine to swell my song.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\u000aor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that\u000ashe would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\u000asister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\u000athe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\u000aimpatient for display.\u000a\u000aMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\u000aapplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\u000amanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\u000ahad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\u000amuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\u000aend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\u000aScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,\u000awith some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\u000adancing at one end of the room.\u000a\u000aMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\u000apassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\u000amuch engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was\u000ahis neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There\u000ais nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first\u000arefinements of polished society.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCertainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\u000athe less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.\u201d\u000a\u000aSir William only smiled. \u201cYour friend performs delightfully,\u201d he\u000acontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \u201cand I doubt\u000anot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\u000ayou often dance at St. James\u2019s?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNever, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have a house in town, I conclude?\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Darcy bowed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond\u000aof superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\u000aLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed\u000ato make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\u000astruck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\u000aher:\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\u000ame to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\u000acannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.\u201d\u000a And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though\u000aextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\u000adrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\u000anot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\u000aher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\u000aall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny\u000ame the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\u000aamusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\u000afor one half-hour.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Darcy is all politeness,\u201d said Elizabeth, smiling.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,\u000awe cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a\u000apartner?\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not\u000ainjured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\u000acomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:\u000a\u000a\u201cI can guess the subject of your reverie.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should imagine not.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings\u000ain this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.\u000aI was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the\u000anothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would\u000aI give to hear your strictures on them!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\u000aagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\u000awhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\u000awould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\u000aMr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Elizabeth Bennet.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Elizabeth Bennet!\u201d repeated Miss Bingley. \u201cI am all astonishment.\u000aHow long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you\u000ajoy?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady\u2019s\u000aimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\u000ato matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is\u000aabsolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;\u000aand, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to\u000aentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\u000athat all was safe, her wit flowed long.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 7\u000a\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet\u2019s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\u000athousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\u000ain default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\u2019s\u000afortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\u000athe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\u000ahad left her four thousand pounds.\u000a\u000aShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to\u000atheir father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\u000aLondon in a respectable line of trade.\u000a\u000aThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\u000aconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\u000athither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and\u000ato a milliner\u2019s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\u000aCatherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;\u000atheir minds were more vacant than their sisters\u2019, and when nothing\u000abetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\u000ahours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\u000athe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\u000afrom their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with\u000anews and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the\u000aneighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the\u000aheadquarters.\u000a\u000aTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most\u000ainteresting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge\u000aof the officers\u2019 names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a\u000asecret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.\u000aPhillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of\u000afelicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and\u000aMr. Bingley\u2019s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation\u000ato their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the\u000aregimentals of an ensign.\u000a\u000aAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\u000aBennet coolly observed:\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\u000aof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\u000aI am now convinced.\u201d\u000a\u000aCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\u000aindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,\u000aand her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\u000anext morning to London.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am astonished, my dear,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cthat you should be so\u000aready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\u000aof anybody\u2019s children, it should not be of my own, however.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\u000ahad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\u000aso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\u000afoolish.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\u000atheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\u000anot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when\u000aI liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\u000aheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\u000ashould want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\u000aColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William\u2019s in\u000ahis regimentals.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMamma,\u201d cried Lydia, \u201cmy aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\u000aCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson\u2019s as they did when they first\u000acame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke\u2019s library.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with\u000aa note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\u000afor an answer. Mrs. Bennet\u2019s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\u000aeagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\u000aJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is from Miss Bingley,\u201d said Jane, and then read it aloud.\u000a\u000a\u201cMY DEAR FRIEND,--\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,\u000awe shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,\u000afor a whole day\u2019s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a\u000aquarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the\u000agentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,\u000a\u000a\u201cCAROLINE BINGLEY\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith the officers!\u201d cried Lydia. \u201cI wonder my aunt did not tell us of\u000a_that_.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDining out,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cthat is very unlucky.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCan I have the carriage?\u201d said Jane.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\u000arain; and then you must stay all night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat would be a good scheme,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cif you were sure that\u000athey would not offer to send her home.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\u2019s chaise to go to Meryton,\u000aand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI had much rather go in the coach.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\u000awanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut if you have got them to-day,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cmy mother\u2019s purpose\u000awill be answered.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\u000awere engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\u000amother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a\u000abad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before\u000ait rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\u000adelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\u000aJane certainly could not come back.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\u201d said Mrs. Bennet more than\u000aonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the\u000anext morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\u000acontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\u000abrought the following note for Elizabeth:\u000a\u000a\u201cMY DEAREST LIZZY,--\u000a\u000a\u201cI find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\u000aimputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not\u000ahear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.\u000aJones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been\u000ato me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\u000amatter with me.--Yours, etc.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, my dear,\u201d said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\u000aaloud, \u201cif your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\u000ashould die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\u000aMr. Bingley, and under your orders.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling\u000acolds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is\u000aall very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though\u000athe carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking\u000awas her only alternative. She declared her resolution.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow can you be so silly,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cas to think of such a\u000athing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\u000athere.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs this a hint to me, Lizzy,\u201d said her father, \u201cto send for the\u000ahorses?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing\u000awhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI admire the activity of your benevolence,\u201d observed Mary, \u201cbut every\u000aimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\u000aexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will go as far as Meryton with you,\u201d said Catherine and Lydia.\u000aElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\u000atogether.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we make haste,\u201d said Lydia, as they walked along, \u201cperhaps we may\u000asee something of Captain Carter before he goes.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\u000aof the officers\u2019 wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\u000afield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\u000aover puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\u000awithin view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face\u000aglowing with the warmth of exercise.\u000a\u000aShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\u000aassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\u000aThat she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such\u000adirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\u000aMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\u000afor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\u000abrother\u2019s manners there was something better than politeness; there\u000awas good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\u000aHurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\u000abrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as\u000ato the occasion\u2019s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\u000athinking only of his breakfast.\u000a\u000aHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\u000aBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not\u000awell enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\u000aimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\u000aalarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed\u000afor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\u000ahowever, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them\u000atogether, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\u000aextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\u000aher.\u000a\u000aWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\u000abegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\u000asolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having\u000aexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught\u000aa violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\u000aadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\u000awas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\u000aached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\u000athe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in\u000afact, nothing to do elsewhere.\u000a\u000aWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\u000aunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\u000awanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\u000ain parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\u000aof the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.\u000aElizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to\u000aLongbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply\u000aof clothes.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 8\u000a\u000a\u000aAt five o\u2019clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\u000aElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\u000apoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\u000amuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\u2019s, she could not make a very\u000afavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\u000athis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\u000ashocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\u000abeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\u000aindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored\u000aElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\u000a\u000aTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\u000aregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\u000aattentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling\u000aherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\u000aothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\u000aengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\u000aHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\u000aeat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain\u000adish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\u000a\u000aWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\u000abegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\u000apronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;\u000ashe had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the\u000asame, and added:\u000a\u000a\u201cShe has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\u000awalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\u000alooked almost wild.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\u000anonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\u000acountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\u000ain mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\u000ahide it not doing its office.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour picture may be very exact, Louisa,\u201d said Bingley; \u201cbut this was\u000aall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably\u000awell when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\u000aescaped my notice.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\u201d said Miss Bingley; \u201cand I am\u000ainclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such\u000aan exhibition.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\u000aabove her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by\u000ait? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\u000aa most country-town indifference to decorum.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\u201d said\u000aBingley.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\u201d observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \u201cthat\u000athis adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot at all,\u201d he replied; \u201cthey were brightened by the exercise.\u201d A\u000ashort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\u000a\u000a\u201cI have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very\u000asweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with\u000asuch a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is\u000ano chance of it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\u000aMeryton.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is capital,\u201d added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\u201d cried Bingley, \u201cit\u000awould not make them one jot less agreeable.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\u000aconsideration in the world,\u201d replied Darcy.\u000a\u000aTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\u000ahearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\u000atheir dear friend\u2019s vulgar relations.\u000a\u000aWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on\u000aleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\u000aShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\u000alate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and\u000awhen it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\u000adownstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\u000aparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\u000athem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\u000aexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\u000abelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you prefer reading to cards?\u201d said he; \u201cthat is rather singular.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Eliza Bennet,\u201d said Miss Bingley, \u201cdespises cards. She is a great\u000areader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\u201d cried Elizabeth; \u201cI am\u000a_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\u201d said Bingley; \u201cand\u000aI hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the\u000atable where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\u000aothers--all that his library afforded.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\u000acredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\u000athan I ever looked into.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\u000ain the room.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am astonished,\u201d said Miss Bingley, \u201cthat my father should have left\u000aso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\u000aPemberley, Mr. Darcy!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt ought to be good,\u201d he replied, \u201cit has been the work of many\u000agenerations.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\u000abooks.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\u000athese.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNeglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\u000athat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\u000ahalf as delightful as Pemberley.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI wish it may.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\u000aneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\u000afiner county in England than Derbyshire.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am talking of possibilities, Charles.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUpon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\u000aPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very\u000alittle attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew\u000anear the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his\u000aeldest sister, to observe the game.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\u201d said Miss Bingley; \u201cwill\u000ashe be as tall as I am?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\u2019s height, or\u000arather taller.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\u000aso much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished\u000afor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is amazing to me,\u201d said Bingley, \u201chow young ladies can have patience\u000ato be so very accomplished as they all are.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAll young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\u000anet purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure\u000aI never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\u000ainformed that she was very accomplished.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour list of the common extent of accomplishments,\u201d said Darcy, \u201chas\u000atoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\u000aotherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very\u000afar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\u000acannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my\u000aacquaintance, that are really accomplished.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNor I, I am sure,\u201d said Miss Bingley.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen,\u201d observed Elizabeth, \u201cyou must comprehend a great deal in your\u000aidea of an accomplished woman.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! certainly,\u201d cried his faithful assistant, \u201cno one can be really\u000aesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\u000awith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\u000adancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides\u000aall this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\u000awalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\u000awill be but half-deserved.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAll this she must possess,\u201d added Darcy, \u201cand to all this she must\u000ayet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\u000aextensive reading.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\u000aI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\u000athis?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and\u000aapplication, and elegance, as you describe united.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\u000aimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\u000aanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\u000abitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\u000aconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\u000aroom.\u000a\u000a\u201cElizabeth Bennet,\u201d said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,\u000a\u201cis one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the\u000aother sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\u000asucceeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\u000a\u201cthere is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\u000ato employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\u000adespicable.\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\u000acontinue the subject.\u000a\u000aElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\u000athat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for\u000aimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\u000abe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\u000aeminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\u000aunwilling to comply with their brother\u2019s proposal; and it was settled\u000athat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\u000awere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\u000adeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\u000ahowever, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief\u000ato his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\u000aattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 9\u000a\u000a\u000aElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\u2019s room, and in the\u000amorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\u000ainquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\u000aand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\u000asisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\u000anote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\u000aown judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and\u000aits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\u000atwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\u000a\u000aHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\u000avery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\u000anot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\u000arestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\u000awould not listen, therefore, to her daughter\u2019s proposal of being carried\u000ahome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\u000ait at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\u000aBingley\u2019s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\u000aattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\u000athat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed I have, sir,\u201d was her answer. \u201cShe is a great deal too ill to be\u000amoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\u000aa little longer on your kindness.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cRemoved!\u201d cried Bingley. \u201cIt must not be thought of. My sister, I am\u000asure, will not hear of her removal.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou may depend upon it, Madam,\u201d said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\u000a\u201cthat Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she\u000aremains with us.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sure,\u201d she added, \u201cif it was not for such good friends I do not\u000aknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers\u000aa vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\u000aalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\u000atemper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are\u000anothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a\u000acharming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the\u000acountry that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it\u000ain a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhatever I do is done in a hurry,\u201d replied he; \u201cand therefore if I\u000ashould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\u000aminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\u201d said Elizabeth.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou begin to comprehend me, do you?\u201d cried he, turning towards her.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\u000athrough I am afraid is pitiful.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate\u000acharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLizzy,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cremember where you are, and do not run on in\u000athe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI did not know before,\u201d continued Bingley immediately, \u201cthat you were a\u000astudier of character. It must be an amusing study.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\u000aleast that advantage.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe country,\u201d said Darcy, \u201ccan in general supply but a few subjects for\u000asuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\u000aunvarying society.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\u000aobserved in them for ever.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning\u000aa country neighbourhood. \u201cI assure you there is quite as much of _that_\u000agoing on in the country as in town.\u201d\u000a\u000aEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\u000aturned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\u000avictory over him, continued her triumph.\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\u000amy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\u000apleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I am in the country,\u201d he replied, \u201cI never wish to leave it;\u000aand when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their\u000aadvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that\u000agentleman,\u201d looking at Darcy, \u201cseemed to think the country was nothing\u000aat all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,\u201d said Elizabeth, blushing for her\u000amother. \u201cYou quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\u000asuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,\u000awhich you must acknowledge to be true.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCertainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting\u000awith many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\u000aneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\u201d\u000a\u000aNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\u000acountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards\u000aMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\u000asaying something that might turn her mother\u2019s thoughts, now asked her if\u000aCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\u000aWilliam is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So\u000agenteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\u000ais my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\u000aimportant, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid Charlotte dine with you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\u000amy part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;\u000a_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to\u000ajudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,\u000aI assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think\u000aCharlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe seems a very pleasant young woman.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\u000ahas often said so, and envied me Jane\u2019s beauty. I do not like to boast\u000aof my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\u000abetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\u000apartiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother\u000aGardiner\u2019s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was\u000asure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he\u000adid not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses\u000aon her, and very pretty they were.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd so ended his affection,\u201d said Elizabeth impatiently. \u201cThere has\u000abeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\u000adiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\u201d said Darcy.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\u000astrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\u000aam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\u201d\u000a\u000aDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\u000atremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\u000aspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\u000aBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\u000aJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\u000aunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\u000acivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\u000aindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\u000asoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\u000aher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\u000aeach other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\u000ayoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\u000ainto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\u000a\u000aLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\u000aand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\u000aaffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\u000aanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\u000aattention of the officers, to whom her uncle\u2019s good dinners, and her own\u000aeasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very\u000aequal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\u000aabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\u000ashameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this\u000asudden attack was delightful to their mother\u2019s ear:\u000a\u000a\u201cI am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\u000ayour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\u000athe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\u201d\u000a\u000aLydia declared herself satisfied. \u201cOh! yes--it would be much better to\u000await till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\u000awould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\u201d she\u000aadded, \u201cI shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\u000aForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\u000ainstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\u2019 behaviour to the\u000aremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\u000acould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\u000aall Miss Bingley\u2019s witticisms on _fine eyes_.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 10\u000a\u000a\u000aThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss\u000aBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\u000acontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined\u000atheir party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.\u000aMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\u000athe progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by\u000amessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\u000aMrs. Hurst was observing their game.\u000a\u000aElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\u000aattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\u000acommendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness\u000aof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\u000awith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\u000aexactly in union with her opinion of each.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe made no answer.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou write uncommonly fast.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a\u000ayear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPray tell your sister that I long to see her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have already told her so once, by your desire.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\u000apens remarkably well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThank you--but I always mend my own.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow can you contrive to write so even?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was silent.\u000a\u000a\u201cTell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;\u000aand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\u000alittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\u000aGrantley\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWill you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At\u000apresent I have not room to do them justice.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\u000aalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me\u000ato determine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\u000aease, cannot write ill.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\u201d cried her\u000abrother, \u201cbecause he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for\u000awords of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy style of writing is very different from yours.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!\u201d cried Miss Bingley, \u201cCharles writes in the most careless way\u000aimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which\u000ameans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour humility, Mr. Bingley,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cmust disarm reproof.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing is more deceitful,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cthan the appearance of\u000ahumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\u000aindirect boast.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\u000awriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\u000athought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\u000athink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\u000aquickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any\u000aattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\u000aBennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield\u000ayou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\u000apanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very\u000alaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\u000aundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNay,\u201d cried Bingley, \u201cthis is too much, to remember at night all the\u000afoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,\u000aI believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\u000amoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\u000aprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\u000ayou would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\u000adependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\u000amounting your horse, a friend were to say, \u2018Bingley, you had better\u000astay till next week,\u2019 you would probably do it, you would probably not\u000ago--and at another word, might stay a month.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have only proved by this,\u201d cried Elizabeth, \u201cthat Mr. Bingley did\u000anot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much\u000amore than he did himself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am exceedingly gratified,\u201d said Bingley, \u201cby your converting what my\u000afriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\u000aafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\u000aintend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a\u000acircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\u000acould.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWould Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions\u000aas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUpon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for\u000ahimself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,\u000abut which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\u000astand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\u000athat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\u000athe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\u000aone argument in favour of its propriety.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\u000awith you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\u000aeither.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\u000afriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\u000aone readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\u000aone into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\u000asupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\u000acircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\u000athereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\u000awhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\u000avery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\u000awith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWill it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\u000aarrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\u000aappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\u000abetween the parties?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBy all means,\u201d cried Bingley; \u201clet us hear all the particulars, not\u000aforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\u000aweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\u000ayou, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\u000amyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\u000aknow a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in\u000aparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\u000awhen he has nothing to do.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\u000arather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\u000aresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\u000abrother for talking such nonsense.\u000a\u000a\u201cI see your design, Bingley,\u201d said his friend. \u201cYou dislike an argument,\u000aand want to silence this.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\u000aBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\u000athankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat you ask,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cis no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\u000aDarcy had much better finish his letter.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\u000a\u000aWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\u000afor an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity\u000ato the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead\u000athe way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\u000aseated herself.\u000a\u000aMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,\u000aElizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\u000athat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy\u2019s eyes were fixed\u000aon her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\u000aadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her\u000abecause he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,\u000ahowever, at last that she drew his notice because there was something\u000amore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\u000aany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\u000ahim too little to care for his approbation.\u000a\u000aAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by\u000aa lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\u000aElizabeth, said to her:\u000a\u000a\u201cDo not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\u000aopportunity of dancing a reel?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\u000asurprise at her silence.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!\u201d said she, \u201cI heard you before, but I could not immediately\u000adetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say \u2018Yes,\u2019\u000athat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\u000adelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\u000atheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\u000ayou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if\u000ayou dare.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed I do not dare.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\u000agallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\u000amanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy\u000ahad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\u000abelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\u000ashould be in some danger.\u000a\u000aMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great\u000aanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some\u000aassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\u000a\u000aShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\u000atheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope,\u201d said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery\u000athe next day, \u201cyou will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\u000adesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\u000aand if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after\u000aofficers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\u000acheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\u000awhich your lady possesses.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHave you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed\u000ain the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the\u000ajudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\u000alines. As for your Elizabeth\u2019s picture, you must not have it taken, for\u000awhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their\u000acolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be\u000acopied.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\u000aElizabeth herself.\u000a\u000a\u201cI did not know that you intended to walk,\u201d said Miss Bingley, in some\u000aconfusion, lest they had been overheard.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou used us abominably ill,\u201d answered Mrs. Hurst, \u201crunning away without\u000atelling us that you were coming out.\u201d\u000a\u000aThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\u000aby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,\u000aand immediately said:\u000a\u000a\u201cThis walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\u000aavenue.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\u000alaughingly answered:\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear\u000ato uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\u000afourth. Good-bye.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of\u000abeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered\u000aas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 11\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\u000asister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the\u000adrawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many\u000aprofessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable\u000aas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.\u000aTheir powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an\u000aentertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh\u000aat their acquaintance with spirit.\u000a\u000aBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\u000aMiss Bingley\u2019s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had\u000asomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\u000ahimself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also\u000amade her a slight bow, and said he was \u201cvery glad;\u201d but diffuseness\u000aand warmth remained for Bingley\u2019s salutation. He was full of joy and\u000aattention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\u000ashould suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire\u000ato the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from\u000athe door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\u000aelse. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\u000adelight.\u000a\u000aWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\u000acard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\u000aDarcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\u000apetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and\u000athe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\u000aHurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the\u000asofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;\u000aand Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets\u000aand rings, joined now and then in her brother\u2019s conversation with Miss\u000aBennet.\u000a\u000aMiss Bingley\u2019s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\u000aDarcy\u2019s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she\u000awas perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\u000acould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\u000aquestion, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\u000aamused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\u000asecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \u201cHow pleasant\u000ait is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no\u000aenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\u000abook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\u000aan excellent library.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\u000acast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing\u000aher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\u000atowards him and said:\u000a\u000a\u201cBy the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\u000aNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\u000athe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are\u000anot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\u000apleasure.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you mean Darcy,\u201d cried her brother, \u201che may go to bed, if he\u000achooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\u000athing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send\u000around my cards.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should like balls infinitely better,\u201d she replied, \u201cif they were\u000acarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\u000atedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\u000amore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of\u000athe day.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMuch more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\u000anear so much like a ball.\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked\u000aabout the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but\u000aDarcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In\u000athe desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,\u000aturning to Elizabeth, said:\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\u000aturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\u000along in one attitude.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\u000asucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked\u000aup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\u000aElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\u000adirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\u000ahe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\u000athe room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\u000ainterfere. \u201cWhat could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\u000ameaning?\u201d--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?\u000a\u000a\u201cNot at all,\u201d was her answer; \u201cbut depend upon it, he means to be severe\u000aon us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing\u000aabout it.\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\u000aanything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his\u000atwo motives.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\u201d said he, as soon\u000aas she allowed him to speak. \u201cYou either choose this method of passing\u000athe evening because you are in each other\u2019s confidence, and have secret\u000aaffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\u000aappear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be\u000acompletely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better\u000aas I sit by the fire.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! shocking!\u201d cried Miss Bingley. \u201cI never heard anything so\u000aabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cWe\u000acan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\u000aas you are, you must know how it is to be done.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has\u000anot yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of\u000amind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will\u000anot expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a\u000asubject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cThat is an\u000auncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\u000abe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a\u000alaugh.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Bingley,\u201d said he, \u201chas given me more credit than can be.\u000aThe wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their\u000aactions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in\u000alife is a joke.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCertainly,\u201d replied Elizabeth--\u201cthere are such people, but I hope I\u000aam not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.\u000aFollies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,\u000aand I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely\u000awhat you are without.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study\u000aof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\u000aunderstanding to ridicule.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSuch as vanity and pride.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\u000asuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\u000a\u000a\u201cYour examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\u201d said Miss Bingley;\u000a\u201cand pray what is the result?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\u000ahimself without disguise.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cI have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\u000abut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\u000afor. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the\u000aconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others\u000aso soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings\u000aare not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\u000awould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost\u000aforever.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_That_ is a failing indeed!\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cImplacable resentment\u000a_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\u000areally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\u000aevil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd _your_ defect is to hate everybody.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd yours,\u201d he replied with a smile, \u201cis willfully to misunderstand\u000athem.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo let us have a little music,\u201d cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\u000aconversation in which she had no share. \u201cLouisa, you will not mind my\u000awaking Mr. Hurst?\u201d\u000a\u000aHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\u000aopened; and Darcy, after a few moments\u2019 recollection, was not sorry for\u000ait. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 12\u000a\u000a\u000aIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the\u000anext morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for\u000athem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on\u000aher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\u000awould exactly finish Jane\u2019s week, could not bring herself to receive\u000athem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\u000aleast not to Elizabeth\u2019s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\u000aBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\u000abefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\u000aand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them\u000avery well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\u000aresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\u000acontrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\u000ashe urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley\u2019s carriage immediately, and at\u000alength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\u000athat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\u000a\u000aThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\u000asaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work\u000aon Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\u000athen sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike\u000aof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\u000a\u000aThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\u000asoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\u000asafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\u000ashe felt herself to be right.\u000a\u000aTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at\u000aNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss\u000aBingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.\u000aHe wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\u000ashould _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope\u000aof influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been\u000asuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\u000ain confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\u000aten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were\u000aat one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most\u000aconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\u000aall, took place. Miss Bingley\u2019s civility to Elizabeth increased at last\u000avery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\u000aafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her\u000ato see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\u000atenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of\u000athe whole party in the liveliest of spirits.\u000a\u000aThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet\u000awondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much\u000atrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their\u000afather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\u000aglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\u000aevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of\u000aits animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and\u000aElizabeth.\u000a\u000aThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human\u000anature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of\u000athreadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information\u000afor them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said\u000ain the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers\u000ahad dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it\u000ahad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 13\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope, my dear,\u201d said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\u000abreakfast the next morning, \u201cthat you have ordered a good dinner to-day,\u000abecause I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,\u000aunless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners\u000aare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cA gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.\u000aBingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.\u000aBingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be\u000agot to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this\u000amoment.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is _not_ Mr. Bingley,\u201d said her husband; \u201cit is a person whom I\u000anever saw in the whole course of my life.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being\u000aeagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.\u000a\u000aAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:\u000a\u000a\u201cAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago\u000aI answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring\u000aearly attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,\u000amay turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! my dear,\u201d cried his wife, \u201cI cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\u000aPray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing\u000ain the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own\u000achildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago\u000ato do something or other about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They\u000ahad often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which\u000aMrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail\u000abitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\u000afive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt certainly is a most iniquitous affair,\u201d said Mr. Bennet, \u201cand\u000anothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\u000aBut if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little\u000asoftened by his manner of expressing himself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of\u000ahim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false\u000afriends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did\u000abefore him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that\u000ahead, as you will hear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.\u000a\u000a\u201cDear Sir,--\u000a\u000a\u201cThe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured\u000afather always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the\u000amisfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but\u000afor some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might\u000aseem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone\u000awith whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--\u2018There, Mrs.\u000aBennet.\u2019--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\u000areceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be\u000adistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de\u000aBourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has\u000apreferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be\u000amy earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her\u000aladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which\u000aare instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I\u000afeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in\u000aall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I\u000aflatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and\u000athat the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate\u000awill be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the\u000aoffered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the\u000ameans of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for\u000ait, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible\u000aamends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to\u000areceive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting\u000aon you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o\u2019clock, and\u000ashall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se\u2019ennight\u000afollowing, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine\u000ais far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided\u000athat some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I\u000aremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and\u000adaughters, your well-wisher and friend,\u000a\u000a\u201cWILLIAM COLLINS\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt four o\u2019clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,\u201d\u000a said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. \u201cHe seems to be a most\u000aconscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will\u000aprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so\u000aindulgent as to let him come to us again.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if\u000ahe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to\u000adiscourage him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThough it is difficult,\u201d said Jane, \u201cto guess in what way he can mean\u000ato make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his\u000acredit.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady\u000aCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying\u000ahis parishioners whenever it were required.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe must be an oddity, I think,\u201d said she. \u201cI cannot make him\u000aout.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he\u000amean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he\u000awould help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the\u000areverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\u000aletter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn point of composition,\u201d said Mary, \u201cthe letter does not seem\u000adefective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\u000athink it is well expressed.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any\u000adegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should\u000acome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had\u000areceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for\u000atheir mother, Mr. Collins\u2019s letter had done away much of her ill-will,\u000aand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\u000aastonished her husband and daughters.\u000a\u000aMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\u000apoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\u000aladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in\u000aneed of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a\u000atall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and\u000astately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\u000abefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\u000adaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this\u000ainstance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did\u000anot doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This\u000agallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\u000aBennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\u000aprove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\u000aoddly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\u000amust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things\u000aI know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\u000awill go when once they come to be entailed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and\u000acould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\u000aforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come\u000aprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,\u000awhen we are better acquainted--\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\u000aother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\u2019s admiration. The\u000ahall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\u000aand his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet\u2019s\u000aheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\u000aown future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and\u000ahe begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its\u000acooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\u000aassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a\u000agood cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He\u000abegged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\u000aherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a\u000aquarter of an hour.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 14\u000a\u000a\u000aDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\u000awere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\u000aguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\u000ashine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\u000aCatherine de Bourgh\u2019s attention to his wishes, and consideration for\u000ahis comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\u000abetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\u000ato more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect\u000ahe protested that \u201che had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in\u000aa person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\u000aexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\u000aapprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of\u000apreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\u000aand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\u000aquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\u000apeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\u000aShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\u000amade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\u000aneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or\u000atwo, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\u000amarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\u000aonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\u000aapproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\u000ato suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cand\u000aI dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\u000ain general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\u000afrom Rosings Park, her ladyship\u2019s residence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\u000aextensive property.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh!\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \u201cthen she is better off than\u000amany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\u000athat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\u000ahandsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks\u000athe young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\u000aconstitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many\u000aaccomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am\u000ainformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\u000aresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\u000ato drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHas she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\u000acourt.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHer indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\u000aand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the\u000aBritish court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased\u000awith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\u000aoffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable\u000ato ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that\u000aher charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\u000aelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\u000aher. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\u000ait is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\u000apay.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou judge very properly,\u201d said Mr. Bennet, \u201cand it is happy for you\u000athat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\u000awhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\u000amoment, or are the result of previous study?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I\u000asometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\u000acompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\u000agive them as unstudied an air as possible.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet\u2019s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\u000aas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\u000amaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\u000aand, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\u000ain his pleasure.\u000a\u000aBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\u000ato take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,\u000aglad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily\u000aassented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything\u000aannounced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and\u000abegging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at\u000ahim, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some\u000adeliberation he chose Fordyce\u2019s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the\u000avolume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three\u000apages, she interrupted him with:\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away\u000aRichard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me\u000aso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\u000aabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\u201d\u000a\u000aLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\u000aCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\u000a\u000a\u201cI have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\u000aof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\u000ame, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to\u000athem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\u201d\u000a\u000aThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\u000abackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\u000avery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.\u000aMrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia\u2019s\u000ainterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\u000aresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\u000ayoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\u000aaffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\u000afor backgammon.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 15\u000a\u000a\u000aMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\u000abeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part\u000aof his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\u000amiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\u000ahad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful\u000aacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\u000agiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a\u000agood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\u000aretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\u000aprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\u000aBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which\u000ahe felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\u000amingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\u000aclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\u000apride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\u000a\u000aHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\u000amarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\u000aa wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\u000athem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\u000aThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father\u2019s\u000aestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\u000asuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\u000apart.\u000a\u000aHis plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet\u2019s lovely face\u000aconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\u000awas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\u000achoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a\u000aquarter of an hour\u2019s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\u000aconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\u000ato the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at\u000aLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\u000aencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. \u201cAs to\u000aher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\u000anot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her\u000a_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her\u000ato hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\u000adone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\u000anext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\u000atwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\u000athe day before was now high in her good graces.\u000a\u000aLydia\u2019s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister\u000aexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\u000aat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\u000aand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\u000ahim after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\u000aone of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\u000aBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\u000adoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\u000aalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\u000aElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the\u000ahouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\u000awas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\u000awalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\u000athan a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.\u000a\u000aIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\u000acousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\u000athe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were\u000aimmediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and\u000anothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in\u000aa shop window, could recall them.\u000a\u000aBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\u000athey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\u000awith another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was\u000athe very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came\u000ato inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the\u000astranger\u2019s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,\u000adetermined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under\u000apretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately\u000ahad just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had\u000areached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated\u000apermission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with\u000ahim the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a\u000acommission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the\u000ayoung man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.\u000aHis appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of\u000abeauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.\u000aThe introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness\u000aof conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\u000aunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together\u000avery agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy\u000aand Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the\u000aladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\u000abegan the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and\u000aMiss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to\u000aLongbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated\u000ait with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes\u000aon Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\u000astranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they\u000alooked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\u000aBoth changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,\u000aafter a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\u000adeigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to\u000aimagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\u000a\u000aIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\u000apassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\u000a\u000aMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\u000aMr. Phillip\u2019s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia\u2019s\u000apressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of\u000aMrs. Phillips\u2019s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the\u000ainvitation.\u000a\u000aMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,\u000afrom their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was\u000aeagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as\u000atheir own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing\u000aabout, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones\u2019s shop-boy in the\u000astreet, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to\u000aNetherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility\u000awas claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\u2019s introduction of him. She\u000areceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned with\u000aas much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous\u000aacquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,\u000ahowever, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who\u000aintroduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an\u000aexcess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon\u000aput to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,\u000ahowever, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that\u000aMr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\u000alieutenant\u2019s commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the\u000alast hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.\u000aWickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the\u000aoccupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the\u000aofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become \u201cstupid,\u000adisagreeable fellows.\u201d Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses\u000athe next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\u000aWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\u000awould come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips\u000aprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\u000atickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\u000adelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\u000aCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured\u000awith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\u000a\u000aAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\u000abetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either\u000aor both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain\u000asuch behaviour than her sister.\u000a\u000aMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring\u000aMrs. Phillips\u2019s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\u000aCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;\u000afor she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even\u000apointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\u000autterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\u000aattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\u000amuch attention in the whole course of his life.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 16\u000a\u000a\u000aAs no objection was made to the young people\u2019s engagement with their\u000aaunt, and all Mr. Collins\u2019s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\u000aa single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\u000aconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and\u000athe girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\u000athat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\u2019s invitation, and was then in\u000athe house.\u000a\u000aWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\u000aCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\u000astruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\u000amight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast\u000aparlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\u000agratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what\u000aRosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the\u000adescription of only one of Lady Catherine\u2019s drawing-rooms, and found\u000athat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\u000athe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\u000awith the housekeeper\u2019s room.\u000a\u000aIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\u000awith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and\u000athe improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\u000agentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive\u000alistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\u000aheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\u000asoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\u000aand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\u000atheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the\u000ainterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\u000aThe gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\u000aElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\u000aof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.\u000aThe officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\u000agentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but\u000aMr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\u000awalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,\u000abreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\u000a\u000aMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\u000aturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\u000ahimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\u000aconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel\u000athat the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered\u000ainteresting by the skill of the speaker.\u000a\u000aWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\u000aofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\u000aladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\u000alistener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly\u000asupplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he\u000ahad the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know little of the game at present,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I shall be glad\u000ato improve myself, for in my situation in life--\u201d Mrs. Phillips was very\u000aglad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\u000a\u000aMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\u000areceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\u000aseemed danger of Lydia\u2019s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\u000adetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\u000ashe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\u000aand exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.\u000aAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\u000aat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear\u000ahim, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\u000atold--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not\u000aeven mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\u000arelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\u000aNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\u000aa hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\u000a\u000a\u201cAbout a month,\u201d said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\u000adrop, added, \u201cHe is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\u000aunderstand.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d replied Mr. Wickham; \u201chis estate there is a noble one. A clear\u000aten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more\u000acapable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for\u000aI have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my\u000ainfancy.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth could not but look surprised.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\u000aseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\u000ayesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs much as I ever wish to be,\u201d cried Elizabeth very warmly. \u201cI have\u000aspent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\u000adisagreeable.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have no right to give _my_ opinion,\u201d said Wickham, \u201cas to his being\u000aagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\u000atoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_\u000ato be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\u000aastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\u000aanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUpon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in\u000athe neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\u000aHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\u000ahim more favourably spoken of by anyone.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot pretend to be sorry,\u201d said Wickham, after a short\u000ainterruption, \u201cthat he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\u000atheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\u000aworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\u000ahigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\u000aill-tempered man.\u201d Wickham only shook his head.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wonder,\u201d said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \u201cwhether he is\u000alikely to be in this country much longer.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\u000awas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\u000anot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\u000awishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\u000aand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\u000aavoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense\u000aof very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he\u000ais. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\u000athat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never\u000abe in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by\u000aa thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\u000ascandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\u000aeverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\u000amemory of his father.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\u000aall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\u000a\u000aMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\u000aneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that\u000ahe had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very\u000aintelligible gallantry.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\u201d he added,\u000a\u201cwhich was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be\u000aa most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\u000afurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\u000aattentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.\u000aSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\u000amy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\u000aA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\u000anow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\u000awas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\u000apossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\u000awere speaking of just now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\u000aliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\u000aI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\u000aand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\u000aelsewhere.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried Elizabeth; \u201cbut how could _that_ be? How could his\u000awill be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\u000agive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\u000aintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\u000aconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\u000ato it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain\u000ait is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was\u000aof an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\u000aless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\u000aanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and\u000aI may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can\u000arecall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort\u000aof men, and that he hates me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSome time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\u000acan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\u000aever as he expressed them.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut what,\u201d said she, after a pause, \u201ccan have been his motive? What can\u000ahave induced him to behave so cruelly?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\u000aattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\u000aless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father\u2019s uncommon\u000aattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\u000anot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\u000aof preference which was often given me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\u000ahim. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be\u000adespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\u000adescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\u000athis.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter a few minutes\u2019 reflection, however, she continued, \u201cI _do_\u000aremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\u000ahis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\u000amust be dreadful.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will not trust myself on the subject,\u201d replied Wickham; \u201cI can hardly\u000abe just to him.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \u201cTo\u000atreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\u000afather!\u201d She could have added, \u201cA young man, too, like _you_, whose very\u000acountenance may vouch for your being amiable\u201d--but she contented herself\u000awith, \u201cand one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,\u000aconnected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\u000apart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\u000asharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\u000afather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,\u000aappears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of\u000ause to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the\u000aPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\u000aintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\u000abe under the greatest obligations to my father\u2019s active superintendence,\u000aand when, immediately before my father\u2019s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\u000avoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\u000abe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow strange!\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cHow abominable! I wonder that the very\u000apride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better\u000amotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for\u000adishonesty I must call it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt _is_ wonderful,\u201d replied Wickham, \u201cfor almost all his actions may\u000abe traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has\u000aconnected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are\u000anone of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\u000aimpulses even than pride.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCan such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money\u000afreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\u000apoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what\u000ahis father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,\u000ato degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\u000aPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\u000awhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\u000acareful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up\u000aas the most attentive and best of brothers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe shook his head. \u201cI wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\u000aspeak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very\u000aproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\u000aof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\u000anothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\u000aand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father\u2019s death, her\u000ahome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\u000aeducation.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\u000ahelp reverting once more to the first, and saying:\u000a\u000a\u201cI am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,\u000awho seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\u000abe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\u000aknow Mr. Bingley?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\u000aDarcy is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cProbably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\u000awant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\u000ahis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is\u000aa very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His\u000apride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\u000asincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something\u000afor fortune and figure.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\u000athe other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\u000aElizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\u000amade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every\u000apoint; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,\u000ahe assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least\u000aimportance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged\u000athat she would not make herself uneasy.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know very well, madam,\u201d said he, \u201cthat when persons sit down to a\u000acard-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I\u000aam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\u000aare undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady\u000aCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\u000alittle matters.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Wickham\u2019s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\u000aa few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\u000awas very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\u000a\u000a\u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\u201d she replied, \u201chas very lately given him\u000aa living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\u000anotice, but he certainly has not known her long.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\u000awere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\u2019s\u000aconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\u000ayesterday.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHer daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\u000abelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\u000aBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\u000aaffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\u000aself-destined for another.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Collins,\u201d said she, \u201cspeaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\u000adaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,\u000aI suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\u000apatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe her to be both in a great degree,\u201d replied Wickham; \u201cI have\u000anot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\u000aher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\u000areputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\u000ashe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\u000aher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her\u000anephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an\u000aunderstanding of the first class.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\u000athey continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper\u000aput an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\u000aWickham\u2019s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise\u000aof Mrs. Phillips\u2019s supper party, but his manners recommended him to\u000aeverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\u000agracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\u000athink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\u000athe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\u000aas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\u000atalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\u000afish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and\u000aMrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\u000aat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\u000athat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\u000abefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 17\u000a\u000a\u000aElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.\u000aWickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she\u000aknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\u000aBingley\u2019s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the\u000averacity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\u000apossibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to\u000ainterest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be\u000adone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,\u000aand throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\u000aotherwise explained.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have both,\u201d said she, \u201cbeen deceived, I dare say, in some way\u000aor other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\u000amisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\u000aconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\u000awithout actual blame on either side.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVery true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on\u000abehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\u000abusiness? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\u000asomebody.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLaugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\u000aopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\u000ait places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\u2019s favourite in such\u000aa manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\u000aimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\u000acharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\u000aexcessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\u2019s being imposed on, than\u000athat Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me\u000alast night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it\u000abe not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his\u000alooks.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\u000athink.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,\u000aif he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair\u000abecame public.\u000a\u000aThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\u000aconversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had\u000abeen speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal\u000ainvitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed\u000afor the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their\u000adear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly\u000aasked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To\u000athe rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet\u000aas much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to\u000athe others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an\u000aactivity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if\u000aeager to escape from Mrs. Bennet\u2019s civilities.\u000a\u000aThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\u000afemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\u000acompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered\u000aby receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\u000aceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\u000asociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\u000aElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\u000aWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy\u2019s look\u000aand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\u000aless on any single event, or any particular person, for though they\u000aeach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\u000ahe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\u000awas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\u000ahad no disinclination for it.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile I can have my mornings to myself,\u201d said she, \u201cit is enough--I\u000athink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\u000aSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those\u000awho consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\u000aeverybody.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth\u2019s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did\u000anot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\u000ahim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley\u2019s invitation, and if\u000ahe did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening\u2019s\u000aamusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\u000ascruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke\u000aeither from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\u000adance.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\u201d said he, \u201cthat a ball\u000aof this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,\u000acan have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing\u000amyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\u000acousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\u000asoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,\u000aa preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\u000acause, and not to any disrespect for her.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\u000aengaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\u000ainstead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help\u000afor it, however. Mr. Wickham\u2019s happiness and her own were perforce\u000adelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins\u2019s proposal accepted with as\u000agood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\u000agallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\u000astruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy\u000aof being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\u000aquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\u000aThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\u000acivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\u000acompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\u000agratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\u000aher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\u000awas extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\u000ato take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\u000aconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and\u000atill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\u000a\u000aIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\u000ayounger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this\u000atime, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there\u000awas such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton\u000aonce. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very\u000ashoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have\u000afound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the\u000aimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than\u000aa dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and\u000aMonday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 18\u000a\u000a\u000aTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\u000avain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\u000adoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty\u000aof meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\u000amight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\u000ausual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\u000athat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\u000amight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose\u000athe dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy\u2019s\u000apleasure in the Bingleys\u2019 invitation to the officers; and though\u000athis was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\u000apronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who\u000atold them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the\u000aday before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,\u000a\u201cI do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\u000ahe had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\u000aElizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\u000aWickham\u2019s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every\u000afeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\u000adisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\u000athe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\u000aAttendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\u000awas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\u000awith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\u000aspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\u000a\u000aBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\u000aof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\u000aspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\u000anot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition\u000ato the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\u000anotice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;\u000athey were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\u000aapologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\u000aaware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\u000apartner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from\u000ahim was ecstasy.\u000a\u000aShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\u000aWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\u000awere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\u000aher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took\u000aher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,\u000awithout knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\u000aimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\u000amind; Charlotte tried to console her:\u000a\u000a\u201cI dare say you will find him very agreeable.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHeaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\u000aa man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\u000aevil.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\u000ahand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a\u000asimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\u000ain the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\u000aanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\u000ashe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\u000areading in her neighbours\u2019 looks, their equal amazement in beholding\u000ait. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\u000aimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\u000afirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\u000abe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\u000asome slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\u000asilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\u000awith:--\u201cIt is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked\u000aabout the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size\u000aof the room, or the number of couples.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\u000asaid.\u000a\u000a\u201cVery well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may\u000aobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But\u000a_now_ we may be silent.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\u000aentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of\u000a_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the\u000atrouble of saying as little as possible.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\u000aimagine that you are gratifying mine?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBoth,\u201d replied Elizabeth archly; \u201cfor I have always seen a great\u000asimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\u000ataciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\u000asomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\u000aposterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\u201d\u000a said he. \u201cHow near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\u000athink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI must not decide on my own performance.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\u000athe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\u000awalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\u000athe temptation, added, \u201cWhen you met us there the other day, we had just\u000abeen forming a new acquaintance.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\u000afeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\u000afor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\u000aconstrained manner said, \u201cMr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners\u000aas may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of\u000a_retaining_ them, is less certain.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\u201d replied Elizabeth\u000awith emphasis, \u201cand in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\u000ahis life.\u201d\u000a\u000aDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\u000athat moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\u000athrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\u000aDarcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on\u000ahis dancing and his partner.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very\u000asuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\u000afirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\u000adisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\u000aespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at\u000aher sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then\u000aflow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You\u000awill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\u000ayoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\u000aWilliam\u2019s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\u000aeyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\u000aJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\u000ahe turned to his partner, and said, \u201cSir William\u2019s interruption has made\u000ame forget what we were talking of.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\u000ainterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.\u000aWe have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we\u000aare to talk of next I cannot imagine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat think you of books?\u201d said he, smiling.\u000a\u000a\u201cBooks--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\u000afeelings.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\u000ano want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\u000asomething else.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\u201d said he,\u000awith a look of doubt.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, always,\u201d she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\u000athoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\u000aby her suddenly exclaiming, \u201cI remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\u000athat you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\u000aunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\u000acreated_.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am,\u201d said he, with a firm voice.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope not.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\u000ato be secure of judging properly at first.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMay I ask to what these questions tend?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMerely to the illustration of _your_ character,\u201d said she, endeavouring\u000ato shake off her gravity. \u201cI am trying to make it out.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd what is your success?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe shook her head. \u201cI do not get on at all. I hear such different\u000aaccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can readily believe,\u201d answered he gravely, \u201cthat reports may vary\u000agreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\u000anot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\u000afear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\u000aopportunity.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\u201d he coldly replied.\u000aShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\u000asilence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,\u000afor in Darcy\u2019s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards\u000aher, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\u000aanother.\u000a\u000aThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and\u000awith an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\u000a\u000a\u201cSo, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!\u000aYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\u000aquestions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among\u000ahis other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late\u000aMr. Darcy\u2019s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to\u000agive implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\u2019s\u000ausing him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has\u000aalways been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\u000aMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but\u000aI know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he\u000acannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother\u000athought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to\u000athe officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself\u000aout of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent\u000athing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\u000aMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\u2019s guilt; but really,\u000aconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHis guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\u201d said\u000aElizabeth angrily; \u201cfor I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\u000athan of being the son of Mr. Darcy\u2019s steward, and of _that_, I can\u000aassure you, he informed me himself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\u000a\u201cExcuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cInsolent girl!\u201d said Elizabeth to herself. \u201cYou are much mistaken\u000aif you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\u000anothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\u000aDarcy.\u201d She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\u000ainquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\u000asuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\u000amarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\u000aElizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\u000aWickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\u000abefore the hope of Jane\u2019s being in the fairest way for happiness.\u000a\u000a\u201cI want to know,\u201d said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\u000asister\u2019s, \u201cwhat you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\u000abeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\u000ayou may be sure of my pardon.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cI have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\u000asatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\u000ahis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\u000aprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\u000athe probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\u000aMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\u000areceived; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s,\u000aMr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has\u000abeen very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\u000asatisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\u000athem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\u000ahim _conditionally_ only.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly;\u000a\u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\u000aBingley\u2019s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\u000asince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\u000athe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of\u000aboth gentlemen as I did before.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\u000awhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\u000adelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.\u000aBingley\u2019s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\u000ain it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\u000ato Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\u000apartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\u000aand told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\u000ato make a most important discovery.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have found out,\u201d said he, \u201cby a singular accident, that there is now\u000ain the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the\u000agentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\u000athe house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady\u000aCatherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have\u000athought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de\u000aBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\u000ain time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to\u000ado, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\u000aignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\u000aI believe him to be Lady Catherine\u2019s _nephew_. It will be in my power to\u000aassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\u2019nnight.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him\u000athat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction\u000aas an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that\u000ait was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\u000aside; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\u000aconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her\u000awith the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\u000aceased speaking, replied thus:\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in\u000ayour excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your\u000aunderstanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide\u000adifference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,\u000aand those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that\u000aI consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with\u000athe highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of\u000abehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to\u000afollow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to\u000aperform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to\u000aprofit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\u000aguide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by\u000aeducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young\u000alady like yourself.\u201d And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\u000aDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose\u000aastonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced\u000ahis speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of\u000ait, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the\u000awords \u201capology,\u201d \u201cHunsford,\u201d and \u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh.\u201d It vexed\u000aher to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him\u000awith unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time\u000ato speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,\u000awas not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy\u2019s contempt seemed\u000aabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\u000aend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\u000aCollins then returned to Elizabeth.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have no reason, I assure you,\u201d said he, \u201cto be dissatisfied with my\u000areception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\u000ame with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying\u000athat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine\u2019s discernment as to be\u000acertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\u000ahandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\u000aher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\u000atrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\u000amade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\u000athat very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\u000acould bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of\u000aendeavouring even to like Bingley\u2019s two sisters. Her mother\u2019s thoughts\u000ashe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\u000aventure near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\u000asupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\u000aplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\u000athat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\u000aopenly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon\u000abe married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet\u000aseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the\u000amatch. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\u000athree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and\u000athen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\u000aJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\u000ashe could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\u000adaughters, as Jane\u2019s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\u000aother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\u000aable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\u000ashe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\u000anecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\u000asuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\u000aBennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\u000aconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\u000afortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\u000achance of it.\u000a\u000aIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\u2019s\u000awords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\u000awhisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\u000achief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\u000amother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\u000asure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\u000anothing _he_ may not like to hear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you\u000ato offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\u000aso doing!\u201d\u000a\u000aNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\u000atalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\u000ablushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\u000aglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\u000ashe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\u000aconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\u000aof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\u000asteady gravity.\u000a\u000aAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\u000ahad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\u000alikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and\u000achicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\u000atranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and\u000ashe had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\u000apreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\u000aentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,\u000abut in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\u000aexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth\u2019s\u000aeyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her\u000aprogress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very\u000aill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks\u000aof the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to\u000afavour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.\u000aMary\u2019s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was\u000aweak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at\u000aJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to\u000aBingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs\u000aof derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\u000aimperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\u000ainterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\u000aand when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, \u201cThat will do\u000aextremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other\u000ayoung ladies have time to exhibit.\u201d\u000a\u000aMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\u000aElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father\u2019s speech, was afraid\u000aher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I,\u201d said Mr. Collins, \u201cwere so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\u000ashould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\u000aair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\u000acompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\u000ato assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time\u000ato music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\u000arector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make\u000asuch an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\u000aoffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\u000athat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\u000aand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\u000aas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\u000athat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,\u000aespecially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit\u000ahim of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\u000aoccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the\u000afamily.\u201d And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had\u000abeen spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many\u000asmiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his\u000awife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,\u000aand observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably\u000aclever, good kind of young man.\u000a\u000aTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to\u000aexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\u000ahave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or\u000afiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\u000athat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\u000afeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\u000amust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\u000ahave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,\u000aand she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\u000agentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\u000a\u000aThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\u000aMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though\u000ahe could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her\u000apower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\u000asomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\u000aHe assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\u000athat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\u000aher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\u000athe whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\u000aher greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\u000agood-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins\u2019s conversation to herself.\u000a\u000aShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\u2019s further notice;\u000athough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\u000adisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\u000aprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\u000ait.\u000a\u000aThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by\u000aa manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of\u000aan hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\u000aheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\u000asister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and\u000awere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\u000aevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\u000alanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\u000along speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\u000asisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\u000apoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\u000anothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\u000aMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\u000arest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\u000asilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\u000amuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \u201cLord,\u000ahow tired I am!\u201d accompanied by a violent yawn.\u000a\u000aWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\u000acivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and\u000aaddressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he\u000awould make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without\u000athe ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,\u000aand he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on\u000aher, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next\u000aday for a short time.\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the\u000adelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\u000asettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\u000asee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\u000amonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought\u000awith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\u000aElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\u000aman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\u000awas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 19\u000a\u000a\u000aThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\u000adeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\u000ahis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\u000ano feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at\u000athe moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\u000aobservances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On\u000afinding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,\u000asoon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\u000a\u000a\u201cMay I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\u000awhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\u000acourse of this morning?\u201d\u000a\u000aBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\u000aBennet answered instantly, \u201cOh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy\u000awill be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I\u000awant you up stairs.\u201d And, gathering her work together, she was hastening\u000aaway, when Elizabeth called out:\u000a\u000a\u201cDear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\u000ame. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\u000agoing away myself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.\u201d And upon\u000aElizabeth\u2019s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to\u000aescape, she added: \u201cLizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.\u000aCollins.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment\u2019s\u000aconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\u000aover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to\u000aconceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between\u000adistress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as\u000athey were gone, Mr. Collins began.\u000a\u000a\u201cBelieve me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\u000adoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\u000awould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\u000aunwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected\u000amother\u2019s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the\u000apurport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\u000adissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\u000asoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of\u000amy future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\u000asubject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for\u000amarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\u000aof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\u000awith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could\u000anot use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,\u000aand he continued:\u000a\u000a\u201cMy reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\u000aevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\u000aof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will\u000aadd very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought\u000ato have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\u000arecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\u000apatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\u000atoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\u000aleft Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\u000aarranging Miss de Bourgh\u2019s footstool, that she said, \u2018Mr. Collins, you\u000amust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose\u000aa gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\u000auseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\u000aincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\u000ayou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\u2019 Allow me, by the\u000away, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice\u000aand kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\u000aadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\u000aanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\u000aacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and\u000arespect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\u000aintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\u000awere directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\u000acan assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\u000abeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\u000afather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\u000amyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\u000athe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\u000aevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not\u000abe for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and\u000aI flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\u000aremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\u000aviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\u000ashall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\u000aaware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\u000ain the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother\u2019s\u000adecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\u000atherefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\u000ano ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are too hasty, sir,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou forget that I have made no\u000aanswer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\u000athe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\u000ayour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to\u000adecline them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not now to learn,\u201d replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\u000ahand, \u201cthat it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\u000aman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\u000afavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a\u000athird time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\u000asaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUpon my word, sir,\u201d cried Elizabeth, \u201cyour hope is a rather\u000aextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\u000aone of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\u000adaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\u000atime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\u000ahappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\u000acould make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\u000aam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\u000asituation.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWere it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\u201d said Mr. Collins\u000avery gravely--\u201cbut I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\u000adisapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of\u000aseeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your\u000amodesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You\u000amust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\u000aof believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\u000arefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\u000aIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\u000afeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\u000aestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may\u000abe considered, therefore, as finally settled.\u201d And rising as she\u000athus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus\u000aaddressed her:\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\u000ashall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\u000ame; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\u000aknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on\u000athe first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\u000aencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\u000afemale character.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cReally, Mr. Collins,\u201d cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \u201cyou puzzle me\u000aexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\u000aof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\u000ato convince you of its being one.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\u000arefusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\u000abelieving it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is\u000aunworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\u000abe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\u000awith the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\u000acircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\u000aconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\u000ameans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\u000aportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo\u000athe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must\u000atherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,\u000aI shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\u000asuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\u000aof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\u000arather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\u000aagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\u000ato accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\u000aforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\u000afemale, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking\u000athe truth from her heart.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are uniformly charming!\u201d cried he, with an air of awkward\u000agallantry; \u201cand I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\u000aauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\u000abeing acceptable.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make\u000ano reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if\u000ahe persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\u000aencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\u000ain such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\u000anot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 20\u000a\u000a\u000aMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\u000asuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\u000ato watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open\u000athe door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\u000aentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\u000awarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\u000areceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\u000aproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\u000aof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\u000arefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\u000afrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\u000a\u000aThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been\u000aglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\u000ahim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\u000aand could not help saying so.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\u201d she added, \u201cthat Lizzy shall be\u000abrought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very\u000aheadstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will\u000a_make_ her know it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPardon me for interrupting you, madam,\u201d cried Mr. Collins; \u201cbut if\u000ashe is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\u000aaltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\u000anaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she\u000aactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not\u000ato force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\u000atemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSir, you quite misunderstand me,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \u201cLizzy is\u000aonly headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\u000agood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\u000awe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\u000ahusband, called out as she entered the library, \u201cOh! Mr. Bennet, you\u000aare wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make\u000aLizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you\u000ado not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\u000aon her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by\u000aher communication.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had\u000afinished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\u000aand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\u000amarrying him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\u000alibrary.\u000a\u000a\u201cCome here, child,\u201d cried her father as she appeared. \u201cI have sent for\u000ayou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\u000ayou an offer of marriage. Is it true?\u201d Elizabeth replied that it was.\u000a\u201cVery well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\u000aaccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, or I will never see her again.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\u000abe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\u000aagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\u000aif you _do_.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,\u000abut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\u000aaffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to\u000a_insist_ upon her marrying him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear,\u201d replied her husband, \u201cI have two small favours to request.\u000aFirst, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\u000apresent occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\u000alibrary to myself as soon as may be.\u201d\u000a\u000aNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\u000aMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\u000acoaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane\u000ain her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\u000ainterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\u000asometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\u000avaried, however, her determination never did.\u000a\u000aMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\u000aHe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin\u000acould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\u000away. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\u000adeserving her mother\u2019s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\u000a\u000aWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\u000athe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\u000aher, cried in a half whisper, \u201cI am glad you are come, for there is such\u000afun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\u000amade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\u201d\u000a\u000aCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,\u000awho came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\u000abreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\u000athe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\u000aher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her\u000afamily. \u201cPray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\u201d she added in a melancholy tone,\u000a\u201cfor nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,\u000anobody feels for my poor nerves.\u201d\u000a\u000aCharlotte\u2019s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\u000a\u000a\u201cAye, there she comes,\u201d continued Mrs. Bennet, \u201clooking as unconcerned\u000aas may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided\u000ashe can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it\u000ainto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\u000ayou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\u000ato maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep\u000ayou--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\u000ayou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\u000aand you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\u000ato undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\u000ato anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\u000ano great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it\u000ais always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\u000aany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the\u000airritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of\u000athem, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with\u000aan air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to\u000athe girls, \u201cNow, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold\u000ayour tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation\u000atogether.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\u000aLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\u000adetained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\u000aherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\u000acuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\u000anot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected\u000aconversation: \u201cOh! Mr. Collins!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear madam,\u201d replied he, \u201clet us be for ever silent on this point.\u000aFar be it from me,\u201d he presently continued, in a voice that marked his\u000adispleasure, \u201cto resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation\u000ato inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a\u000ayoung man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;\u000aand I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt\u000aof my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;\u000afor I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as\u000awhen the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\u000aestimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect\u000ato your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to\u000ayour daughter\u2019s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\u000acompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my\u000abehalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\u000adismission from your daughter\u2019s lips instead of your own. But we are all\u000aliable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\u000aMy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\u000aconsideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_\u000ahas been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 21\u000a\u000a\u000aThe discussion of Mr. Collins\u2019s offer was now nearly at an end, and\u000aElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\u000aattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her\u000amother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly\u000aexpressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,\u000abut by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke\u000ato her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\u000ahimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\u000acivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\u000aespecially to her friend.\u000a\u000aThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet\u2019s ill-humour or ill\u000ahealth. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth\u000ahad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\u000anot appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on\u000aSaturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.\u000a\u000aAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham\u000awere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\u000aHe joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\u000aaunt\u2019s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was\u000awell talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\u000athat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI found,\u201d said he, \u201cas the time drew near that I had better not meet\u000aMr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\u000amany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\u000amight arise unpleasant to more than myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full\u000adiscussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly\u000abestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\u000athem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to\u000aher. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the\u000acompliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an\u000aoccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\u000a\u000aSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\u000afrom Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,\u000ahot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\u2019s fair, flowing hand; and\u000aElizabeth saw her sister\u2019s countenance change as she read it, and saw\u000aher dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected\u000aherself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual\u000acheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety\u000aon the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no\u000asooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\u000ainvited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,\u000aJane, taking out the letter, said:\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good\u000adeal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\u000atheir way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You\u000ashall hear what she says.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\u000aof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\u000aand of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a\u000ahouse. The next was in these words: \u201cI do not pretend to regret anything\u000aI shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;\u000abut we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\u000adelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\u000alessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved\u000acorrespondence. I depend on you for that.\u201d To these highflown\u000aexpressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;\u000aand though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw\u000anothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\u000aabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley\u2019s being there; and as\u000ato the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to\u000aregard it, in the enjoyment of his.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is unlucky,\u201d said she, after a short pause, \u201cthat you should not be\u000aable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\u000ahope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\u000aforward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\u000aintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\u000asatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\u000athem.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCaroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\u000aHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\u000atook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\u000aare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\u000aCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\u000adetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\u000ahis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are\u000aalready there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my\u000adearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of\u000athat I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may\u000aabound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your\u000abeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the\u000athree of whom we shall deprive you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is evident by this,\u201d added Jane, \u201cthat he comes back no more this\u000awinter.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own\u000amaster. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\u000aparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,\u000a_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think\u000aGeorgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;\u000aand the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into\u000asomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of\u000aher being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\u000amentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the\u000acountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\u000aunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\u000afrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;\u000aher relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister\u2019s\u000apartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\u000acapable of engaging any woman\u2019s heart. With all these circumstances to\u000afavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\u000aJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\u000aof so many?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\u201d said Jane as she\u000afinished it. \u201cIs it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that\u000aCaroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is\u000aperfectly convinced of her brother\u2019s indifference; and that if she\u000asuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\u000aput me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMost willingly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\u000ain love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him\u000ato town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\u000adoes not care about you.\u201d\u000a\u000aJane shook her head.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\u000atogether can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She\u000ais not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\u000aDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\u000acase is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\u000ais the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\u000athat when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble\u000ain achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and\u000aI dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\u000amy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\u000atells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\u000adegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\u000aTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\u000aof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cyour\u000arepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\u000afoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\u000aanyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving\u000aherself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\u000awill not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.\u000aYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\u000aaccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\u000aelsewhere?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must decide for yourself,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cand if, upon mature\u000adeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\u000amore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\u000aall means to refuse him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow can you talk so?\u201d said Jane, faintly smiling. \u201cYou must know that\u000athough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\u000anot hesitate.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\u000ayour situation with much compassion.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\u000arequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\u000acontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline\u2019s\u000ainterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\u000awishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\u000aso totally independent of everyone.\u000a\u000aShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\u000aon the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\u000aJane\u2019s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\u000athough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\u000aBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\u000a\u000aThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\u000afamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman\u2019s conduct;\u000abut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\u000aand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\u000ato go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\u000alamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\u000aBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the\u000aconclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had\u000abeen invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two\u000afull courses.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 22\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the\u000achief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\u000aElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. \u201cIt keeps him in good\u000ahumour,\u201d said she, \u201cand I am more obliged to you than I can express.\u201d\u000a Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\u000athat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\u000avery amiable, but Charlotte\u2019s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\u000ahad any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\u000afrom any return of Mr. Collins\u2019s addresses, by engaging them towards\u000aherself. Such was Miss Lucas\u2019s scheme; and appearances were so\u000afavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\u000asecure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very\u000asoon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\u000acharacter, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\u000amorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\u000ahimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\u000afrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\u000aconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\u000atill its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost\u000asecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\u000ahe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.\u000aHis reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\u000aperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\u000ainstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\u000ashe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\u000a\u000aIn as short a time as Mr. Collins\u2019s long speeches would allow,\u000aeverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\u000athey entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\u000awas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\u000abe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\u000ahis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\u000aguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\u000acontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure\u000aand disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\u000aestablishment were gained.\u000a\u000aSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\u000aand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins\u2019s present\u000acircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\u000athey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\u000aexceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\u000ainterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer\u000aMr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\u000aopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\u000aLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\u000ashould make their appearance at St. James\u2019s. The whole family, in short,\u000awere properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes\u000aof _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have\u000adone; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\u2019s\u000adying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had\u000agained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were\u000ain general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible\u000anor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must\u000abe imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly\u000aeither of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was\u000athe only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,\u000aand however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\u000apreservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at\u000athe age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all\u000athe good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business\u000awas the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship\u000ashe valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,\u000aand probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\u000ashaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\u000ato give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\u000awhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\u000apassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\u000adutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\u000acuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\u000aquestions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\u000aat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\u000apublish his prosperous love.\u000a\u000aAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the\u000afamily, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved\u000afor the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,\u000asaid how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever\u000ahis engagements might allow him to visit them.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear madam,\u201d he replied, \u201cthis invitation is particularly\u000agratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\u000ayou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\u000apossible.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\u000aso speedy a return, immediately said:\u000a\u000a\u201cBut is there not danger of Lady Catherine\u2019s disapprobation here, my\u000agood sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\u000aoffending your patroness.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear sir,\u201d replied Mr. Collins, \u201cI am particularly obliged to you\u000afor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\u000amaterial a step without her ladyship\u2019s concurrence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her\u000adispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\u000aagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\u000aand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBelieve me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\u000aaffectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\u000afrom me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your\u000aregard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though\u000amy absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now\u000atake the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my\u000acousin Elizabeth.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\u000asurprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to\u000aunderstand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her\u000ayounger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\u000aShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was\u000aa solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\u000ameans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read\u000aand improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\u000aagreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this\u000akind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\u000aprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\u000a\u000aThe possibility of Mr. Collins\u2019s fancying himself in love with her\u000afriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\u000athat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from\u000apossibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was\u000aconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\u000ashe could not help crying out:\u000a\u000a\u201cEngaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\u000astory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\u000areproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\u000aher composure, and calmly replied:\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\u000athat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\u2019s good opinion,\u000abecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\u000afor it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of\u000atheir relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her\u000aall imaginable happiness.\u000a\u000a\u201cI see what you are feeling,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cYou must be surprised,\u000avery much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry\u000ayou. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be\u000asatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never\u000awas. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\u2019s\u000acharacter, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\u000achance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\u000aentering the marriage state.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth quietly answered \u201cUndoubtedly;\u201d and after an awkward pause,\u000athey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\u000alonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.\u000aIt was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\u000aunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers\u000aof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\u000aaccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was\u000anot exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible\u000athat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\u000afeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a\u000amost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself\u000aand sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it\u000awas impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\u000achosen.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 23\u000a\u000a\u000aElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\u000ashe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention\u000ait, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to\u000aannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,\u000aand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\u000ahouses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but\u000aincredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,\u000aprotested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\u000aoften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\u000a\u000a\u201cGood Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\u000athat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\u201d\u000a\u000aNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\u000awithout anger such treatment; but Sir William\u2019s good breeding carried\u000ahim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\u000atruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\u000amost forbearing courtesy.\u000a\u000aElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\u000aa situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\u000amentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\u000aendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters\u000aby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\u000awas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\u000ahappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\u000aof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\u000aSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\u000afound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\u000athe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\u000ahad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be\u000ahappy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\u000ainferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\u000aElizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she\u000aherself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two\u000apoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\u000aconsole and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\u000aresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\u000ascolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\u000aor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she\u000acould at all forgive their daughter.\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet\u2019s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\u000aas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\u000ait gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\u000abeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\u000amore foolish than his daughter!\u000a\u000aJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\u000aless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\u000anor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty\u000aand Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\u000aclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\u000ato spread at Meryton.\u000a\u000aLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort\u000aon Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\u000acalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\u000athough Mrs. Bennet\u2019s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\u000aenough to drive happiness away.\u000a\u000aBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\u000amutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that\u000ano real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\u000adisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\u000asister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\u000anever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,\u000aas Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his\u000areturn.\u000a\u000aJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\u000athe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\u000aletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to\u000atheir father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\u000atwelvemonth\u2019s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging\u000ahis conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\u000arapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection\u000aof their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was\u000amerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready\u000ato close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither\u000ahe hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,\u000ahe added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take\u000aplace as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable\u000aargument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him\u000athe happiest of men.\u000a\u000aMr. Collins\u2019s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\u000apleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\u000acomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come\u000ato Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\u000aand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\u000awhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\u000amost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and\u000athey gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\u2019s continued\u000aabsence.\u000a\u000aNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\u000aday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\u000areport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\u000aNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\u000aBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\u000afalsehood.\u000a\u000aEven Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\u000ahis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as\u000ashe was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\u2019s happiness, and so\u000adishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\u000afrequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters\u000aand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\u000aDarcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for\u000athe strength of his attachment.\u000a\u000aAs for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\u000apainful than Elizabeth\u2019s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of\u000aconcealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\u000awas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,\u000aan hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\u000aimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\u000adid not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed\u000aall Jane\u2019s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\u000atranquillity.\u000a\u000aMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his\u000areception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\u000afirst introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\u000aand luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\u000afrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\u000ahim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\u000ato make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\u000aanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,\u000aand wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight\u000aof Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\u000aregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\u000athem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\u000awhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\u000athey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\u000aand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She\u000acomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, Mr. Bennet,\u201d said she, \u201cit is very hard to think that Charlotte\u000aLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to\u000amake way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\u000abetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of\u000amaking any answer, she went on as before.\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\u000anot for the entail, I should not mind it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat should not you mind?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should not mind anything at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\u000ainsensibility.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How\u000aanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\u2019s own\u000adaughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!\u000aWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI leave it to yourself to determine,\u201d said Mr. Bennet.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 24\u000a\u000a\u000aMiss Bingley\u2019s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\u000asentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\u000athe winter, and concluded with her brother\u2019s regret at not having had\u000atime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\u000athe country.\u000a\u000aHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest\u000aof the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\u000awriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy\u2019s praise occupied\u000athe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline\u000aboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\u000athe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\u000aletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother\u2019s being an\u000ainmate of Mr. Darcy\u2019s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\u000athe latter with regard to new furniture.\u000a\u000aElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\u000aheard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\u000afor her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline\u2019s\u000aassertion of her brother\u2019s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no\u000acredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\u000ahad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\u000acould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\u000aof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\u000aof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\u000ato the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,\u000abeen the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\u000awhatever manner he thought best, but her sister\u2019s was involved in it, as\u000ashe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,\u000aon which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\u000acould think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley\u2019s regard had really\u000adied away, or were suppressed by his friends\u2019 interference; whether\u000ahe had been aware of Jane\u2019s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\u000aobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be\u000amaterially affected by the difference, her sister\u2019s situation remained\u000athe same, her peace equally wounded.\u000a\u000aA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\u000aElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\u2019s leaving them together, after a\u000alonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\u000anot help saying:\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no\u000aidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But\u000aI will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\u000aall be as we were before.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\u000anothing.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou doubt me,\u201d cried Jane, slightly colouring; \u201cindeed, you have\u000ano reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\u000aacquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,\u000aand nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A\u000alittle time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith a stronger voice she soon added, \u201cI have this comfort immediately,\u000athat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\u000ahas done no harm to anyone but myself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Jane!\u201d exclaimed Elizabeth, \u201cyou are too good. Your sweetness\u000aand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say\u000ato you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\u000adeserve.\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\u000athe praise on her sister\u2019s warm affection.\u000a\u000a\u201cNay,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthis is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\u000aworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want\u000ato think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not\u000abe afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\u000aprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\u000awhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\u000aof the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\u000amy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\u000alittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\u000asense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the\u000aother is Charlotte\u2019s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is\u000aunaccountable!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\u000aruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference\u000aof situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\u2019s respectability, and\u000aCharlotte\u2019s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a\u000alarge family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be\u000aready to believe, for everybody\u2019s sake, that she may feel something like\u000aregard and esteem for our cousin.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\u000acould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\u000aCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\u000aunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\u000aconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as\u000aI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him\u000acannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\u000ait is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\u000achange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\u000ayourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\u000adanger security for happiness.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\u201d replied\u000aJane; \u201cand I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy\u000atogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\u000amentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\u000ayou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\u000asaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\u000aourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\u000ato be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\u000aour own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\u000ait does.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd men take care that they should.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\u000aof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\u2019s conduct to design,\u201d\u000a said Elizabeth; \u201cbut without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\u000aunhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,\u000awant of attention to other people\u2019s feelings, and want of resolution,\u000awill do the business.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd do you impute it to either of those?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what\u000aI think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, in conjunction with his friend.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can\u000aonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can\u000asecure it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\u000ahappiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\u000amay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\u000aconnections, and pride.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBeyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\u201d replied Jane;\u000a\u201cbut this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have\u000aknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\u000aher better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\u000athey should have opposed their brother\u2019s. What sister would think\u000aherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\u000aobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try\u000ato part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\u000aaffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\u000aunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\u000amistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what\u000aI should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in\u000athe best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley\u2019s\u000aname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\u000amore, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\u000afor it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with\u000aless perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she\u000adid not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the\u000aeffect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her\u000ano more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\u000athe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet\u2019s best\u000acomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \u201cSo, Lizzy,\u201d said he one day,\u000a\u201cyour sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to\u000abeing married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.\u000aIt is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction\u000aamong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to\u000abe long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in\u000aMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham\u000abe _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\u000aall expect Jane\u2019s good fortune.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTrue,\u201d said Mr. Bennet, \u201cbut it is a comfort to think that whatever of\u000athat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make\u000athe most of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Wickham\u2019s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom\u000awhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn\u000afamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\u000aadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\u000aheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\u000awas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\u000apleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they\u000ahad known anything of the matter.\u000a\u000aMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be\u000aany extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society\u000aof Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\u000aallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else\u000aMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 25\u000a\u000a\u000aAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,\u000aMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of\u000aSaturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his\u000aside, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason\u000ato hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would\u000abe fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his\u000arelations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair\u000acousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another\u000aletter of thanks.\u000a\u000aOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving\u000aher brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas\u000aat Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly\u000asuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield\u000aladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived\u000aby trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so\u000awell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger\u000athan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\u000awoman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the\u000atwo eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.\u000aThey had frequently been staying with her in town.\u000a\u000aThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s business on her arrival was to\u000adistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was\u000adone she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.\u000aMrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They\u000ahad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her\u000agirls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was\u000anothing in it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not blame Jane,\u201d she continued, \u201cfor Jane would have got Mr.\u000aBingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think\u000athat she might have been Mr. Collins\u2019s wife by this time, had it not\u000abeen for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,\u000aand she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have\u000aa daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just\u000aas much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,\u000asister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of\u000athem, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted\u000aso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\u000abefore anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the\u000agreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of\u000along sleeves.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,\u000ain the course of Jane and Elizabeth\u2019s correspondence with her, made her\u000asister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the\u000aconversation.\u000a\u000aWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \u201cIt\u000aseems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\u201d said she. \u201cI am\u000asorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such\u000aas you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl\u000afor a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets\u000aher, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAn excellent consolation in its way,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cbut it will not\u000ado for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often\u000ahappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\u000aindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in\u000alove with only a few days before.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut that expression of \u2018violently in love\u2019 is so hackneyed, so\u000adoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\u000aoften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\u2019s acquaintance,\u000aas to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley\u2019s\u000alove?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\u000ainattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\u000athey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\u000aoffended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I\u000aspoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be\u000afiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\u000aJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\u000aover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\u000awould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she\u000awould be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be\u000aof service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\u000aanything.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\u000aof her sister\u2019s ready acquiescence.\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope,\u201d added Mrs. Gardiner, \u201cthat no consideration with regard to\u000athis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\u000atown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\u000aout so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,\u000aunless he really comes to see her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\u000afriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such\u000aa part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may\u000aperhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\u000awould hardly think a month\u2019s ablution enough to cleanse him from its\u000aimpurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\u000anever stirs without him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\u000acorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe will drop the acquaintance entirely.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\u000apoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\u2019s being\u000awithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\u000aconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\u000ahopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\u000ahis affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends\u000asuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane\u2019s\u000aattractions.\u000a\u000aMiss Bennet accepted her aunt\u2019s invitation with pleasure; and the\u000aBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she\u000ahoped by Caroline\u2019s not living in the same house with her brother,\u000ashe might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of\u000aseeing him.\u000a\u000aThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,\u000athe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its\u000aengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment\u000aof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family\u000adinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always\u000amade part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and\u000aon these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\u2019s\u000awarm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,\u000afrom what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference\u000aof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and\u000ashe resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left\u000aHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such\u000aan attachment.\u000a\u000aTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\u000aunconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,\u000abefore her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very\u000apart of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many\u000aacquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since\u000athe death of Darcy\u2019s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher\u000aintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of\u000aprocuring.\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\u000acharacter perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject\u000aof discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute\u000adescription which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of\u000apraise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both\u000ahim and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy\u2019s\u000atreatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman\u2019s\u000areputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and\u000awas confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam\u000aDarcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 26\u000a\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner\u2019s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given\u000aon the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after\u000ahonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because\u000ayou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking\u000aopenly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\u000ayourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want\u000aof fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\u000a_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\u000aought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you\u000amust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\u000aexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\u000agood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\u000amyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\u000acan prevent it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cElizabeth, you are not serious now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with\u000aMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\u000athe most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\u000ame--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\u000aof it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father\u2019s opinion of me does\u000ame the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\u000afather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\u000ashould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\u000asince we see every day that where there is affection, young people\u000aare seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into\u000aengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\u000aof my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it\u000awould be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not\u000ato be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first\u000aobject. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,\u000aI will do my best.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\u000aoften. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs I did the other day,\u201d said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: \u201cvery\u000atrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine\u000athat he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\u000aso frequently invited this week. You know my mother\u2019s ideas as to the\u000anecessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\u000ahonour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope\u000ayou are satisfied.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for\u000athe kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice\u000abeing given on such a point, without being resented.\u000a\u000aMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted\u000aby the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,\u000ahis arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was\u000anow fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think\u000ait inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that\u000ashe \u201c_wished_ they might be happy.\u201d Thursday was to be the wedding day,\u000aand on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she\u000arose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\u2019s ungracious and\u000areluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her\u000aout of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:\u000a\u000a\u201cI shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_That_ you certainly shall.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to\u000acome to Hunsford.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the\u000avisit.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy father and Maria are coming to me in March,\u201d added Charlotte, \u201cand I\u000ahope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as\u000awelcome as either of them.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from\u000athe church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on\u000athe subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their\u000acorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that\u000ait should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never\u000aaddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,\u000aand though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\u000asake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte\u2019s first letters\u000awere received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\u000acuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\u000alike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to\u000abe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\u000aexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\u000awrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\u000awhich she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\u000aroads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\u2019s behaviour was most\u000afriendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\u2019s picture of Hunsford and\u000aRosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\u000afor her own visit there to know the rest.\u000a\u000aJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their\u000asafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it\u000awould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\u000a\u000aHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience\u000agenerally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or\u000ahearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that\u000aher last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been\u000alost.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy aunt,\u201d she continued, \u201cis going to-morrow into that part of the\u000atown, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\u000a\u201cI did not think Caroline in spirits,\u201d were her words, \u201cbut she was very\u000aglad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming\u000ato London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached\u000aher. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\u000aengaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\u000aMiss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was\u000anot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall\u000asee them soon here.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\u000aaccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\u2019s being in town.\u000a\u000aFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\u000apersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\u000ablind to Miss Bingley\u2019s inattention. After waiting at home every morning\u000afor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\u000avisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,\u000athe alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no\u000alonger. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\u000aprove what she felt.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her\u000abetter judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been\u000aentirely deceived in Miss Bingley\u2019s regard for me. But, my dear sister,\u000athough the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I\u000astill assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was\u000aas natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for\u000awishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to\u000ahappen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not\u000areturn my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I\u000areceive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that\u000ashe had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\u000acalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was\u000ain every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was\u000aperfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,\u000athough I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out\u000aas she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on\u000aher side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting\u000awrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the\u000acause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know\u000athis anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily\u000aaccount for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to\u000ahis sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\u000aamiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,\u000abecause, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.\u000aHe knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said\u000aherself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she\u000awanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I\u000acannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\u000abe almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity\u000ain all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,\u000aand think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the\u000ainvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very\u000asoon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield\u000aagain, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better\u000anot mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts\u000afrom our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and\u000aMaria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she\u000aconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\u000aAll expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\u000aeven wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on\u000aevery review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\u000aadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\u000aDarcy\u2019s sister, as by Wickham\u2019s account, she would make him abundantly\u000aregret what he had thrown away.\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\u000aconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth\u000ahad such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\u000aherself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\u000ahe was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\u000asee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\u000aHer heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\u000awith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\u000apermitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\u000aremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself\u000aagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\u000ain Charlotte\u2019s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\u000aNothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to\u000asuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\u000aready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\u000asincerely wish him happy.\u000a\u000aAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the\u000acircumstances, she thus went on: \u201cI am now convinced, my dear aunt, that\u000aI have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure\u000aand elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and\u000awish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\u000atowards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\u000aout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to\u000athink her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My\u000awatchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\u000ainteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love\u000awith him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\u000aImportance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take\u000ahis defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the\u000aways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that\u000ahandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 27\u000a\u000a\u000aWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise\u000adiversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and\u000asometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take\u000aElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of\u000agoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan\u000aand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure\u000aas well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing\u000aCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There\u000awas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\u000auncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\u000awas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her\u000aa peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have\u000abeen very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,\u000aand was finally settled according to Charlotte\u2019s first sketch. She was\u000ato accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement\u000aof spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became\u000aperfect as plan could be.\u000a\u000aThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,\u000aand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he\u000atold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\u000a\u000aThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on\u000ahis side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that\u000aElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the\u000afirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner\u000aof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of\u000awhat she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their\u000aopinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there\u000awas a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to\u000ahim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,\u000awhether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable\u000aand pleasing.\u000a\u000aHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\u000athink him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a\u000agood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say\u000athat could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much\u000adelight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but\u000ashe had known Sir William\u2019s too long. He could tell her nothing new of\u000athe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were\u000aworn out, like his information.\u000a\u000aIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\u000aas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner\u2019s\u000adoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when\u000athey entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\u000alooking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\u000alovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\u000awhose eagerness for their cousin\u2019s appearance would not allow them to\u000await in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen\u000aher for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\u000akindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\u000ashopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\u000a\u000aElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her\u000asister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to\u000aher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\u000aspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,\u000ato hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\u000aparticulars also of Miss Bingley\u2019s visit in Gracechurch Street, and\u000arepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\u000aherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\u000aacquaintance.\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham\u2019s desertion, and\u000acomplimented her on bearing it so well.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut my dear Elizabeth,\u201d she added, \u201cwhat sort of girl is Miss King? I\u000ashould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\u000abetween the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,\u000aand avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\u000abecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get\u000aa girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\u000amercenary.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\u000awhat to think.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\u2019s death\u000amade her mistress of this fortune.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\u000aaffections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\u000amaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\u000apoor?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her\u000aso soon after this event.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\u000adecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,\u000awhy should _we_?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being\u000adeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell,\u201d cried Elizabeth, \u201chave it as you choose. _He_ shall be\u000amercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\u000ato think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in\u000aDerbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not\u000amuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow\u000awhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\u000aneither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones\u000aworth knowing, after all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTake care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.\u201d\u000a\u000aBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\u000aunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\u000aa tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have not determined how far it shall carry us,\u201d said Mrs. Gardiner,\u000a\u201cbut, perhaps, to the Lakes.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\u000aacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. \u201cOh, my dear,\u000adear aunt,\u201d she rapturously cried, \u201cwhat delight! what felicity! You\u000agive me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What\u000aare young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport\u000awe shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other\u000atravellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We\u000a_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.\u000aLakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our\u000aimaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,\u000awill we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_\u000afirst effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of\u000atravellers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 28\u000a\u000a\u000aEvery object in the next day\u2019s journey was new and interesting to\u000aElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had\u000aseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\u000aand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\u000a\u000aWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\u000asearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\u000aThe palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\u000asmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\u000a\u000aAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\u000aroad, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,\u000aeverything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\u000aappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which\u000aled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\u000athe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\u000aat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\u000aliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\u000acoming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\u000ainstantly that her cousin\u2019s manners were not altered by his marriage;\u000ahis formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\u000aminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\u000afamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\u000aneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they\u000awere in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\u000aformality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife\u2019s\u000aoffers of refreshment.\u000a\u000aElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\u000ain fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its\u000aaspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,\u000aas if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But\u000athough everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to\u000agratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at\u000aher friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.\u000aWhen Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\u000aashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her\u000aeye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but\u000ain general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to\u000aadmire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to\u000athe fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\u000ahappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\u000agarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\u000awhich he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most\u000arespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\u000awith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\u000aowned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\u000athrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\u000ainterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\u000awith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\u000afields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\u000athe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\u000athe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the\u000aprospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered\u000athe park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome\u000amodern building, well situated on rising ground.\u000a\u000aFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\u000abut the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\u000afrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\u000atook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\u000aprobably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband\u2019s\u000ahelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\u000awas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which\u000aElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\u000aforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\u000aCharlotte\u2019s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\u000aforgotten.\u000a\u000aShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\u000awas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\u000ain, observed:\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\u000ade Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\u000abe delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\u000adoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice\u000awhen service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she\u000awill include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\u000ahonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\u000acharming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed\u000ato walk home. Her ladyship\u2019s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\u000a_should_ say, one of her ladyship\u2019s carriages, for she has several.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\u201d added\u000aCharlotte, \u201cand a most attentive neighbour.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVery true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\u000awoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,\u000aand telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,\u000aElizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\u000aCharlotte\u2019s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\u000aand composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\u000awas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit\u000awould pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious\u000ainterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with\u000aRosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\u000a\u000aAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\u000afor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\u000aconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\u000aup stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\u000athe door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with\u000aagitation, cried out--\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\u000athere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\u000ahaste, and come down this moment.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,\u000aand down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in\u000aquest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the\u000agarden gate.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd is this all?\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cI expected at least that the pigs\u000awere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her\u000adaughter.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLa! my dear,\u201d said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \u201cit is not\u000aLady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;\u000athe other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\u000acreature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\u000aWhy does she not come in?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\u000awhen Miss de Bourgh comes in.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI like her appearance,\u201d said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \u201cShe\u000alooks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\u000amake him a very proper wife.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\u000awith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\u2019s high diversion, was\u000astationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\u000abefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that\u000away.\u000a\u000aAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\u000athe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\u000agirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\u000aCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\u000ato dine at Rosings the next day.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 29\u000a\u000a\u000aMr. Collins\u2019s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\u000aThe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\u000avisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\u000awife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity\u000aof doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady\u000aCatherine\u2019s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.\u000a\u000a\u201cI confess,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I should not have been at all surprised by\u000aher ladyship\u2019s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at\u000aRosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it\u000awould happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who\u000acould have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there\u000a(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately\u000aafter your arrival!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am the less surprised at what has happened,\u201d replied Sir William,\u000a\u201cfrom that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\u000amy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\u000ainstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\u201d\u000a\u000aScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\u000avisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\u000athey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\u000aso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\u000a\u000aWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--\u000a\u000a\u201cDo not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\u000aCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\u000abecomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\u000awhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\u000afor anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you\u000afor being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\u000apreserved.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\u000adoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\u000aobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\u000aher ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas\u000awho had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her\u000aintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\u000ato his presentation at St. James\u2019s.\u000a\u000aAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\u000amile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\u000aElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\u000araptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\u000aslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\u000ahouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\u000acost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\u000a\u000aWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\u2019s alarm was every\u000amoment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\u000aElizabeth\u2019s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\u000aCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\u000amiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought\u000ashe could witness without trepidation.\u000a\u000aFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\u000arapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they\u000afollowed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady\u000aCatherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,\u000awith great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had\u000asettled it with her husband that the office of introduction should\u000abe hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those\u000aapologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.\u000a\u000aIn spite of having been at St. James\u2019s, Sir William was so completely\u000aawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\u000aenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\u000aand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\u000aof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\u000aquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\u000acomposedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\u000afeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\u000aconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\u000avisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\u000asilence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,\u000aas marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\u000aElizabeth\u2019s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she\u000abelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.\u000a\u000aWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\u000ashe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\u000adaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria\u2019s astonishment at her\u000abeing so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\u000alikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\u000afeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\u000alittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\u000athere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\u000ato what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\u000aher eyes.\u000a\u000aAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\u000aadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\u000aand Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\u000alooking at in the summer.\u000a\u000aThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and\u000aall the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had\u000alikewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her\u000aladyship\u2019s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\u000anothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\u000aalacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir\u000aWilliam, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law\u000asaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\u000aBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and\u000agave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved\u000aa novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\u000awas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\u000abetween Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\u000alistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\u000adinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little\u000aMiss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\u000ashe was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\u000agentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\u000a\u000aWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\u000abe done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\u000aintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\u000asubject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to\u000ahave her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte\u2019s domestic\u000aconcerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as\u000ato the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\u000aregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\u000acare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\u000abeneath this great lady\u2019s attention, which could furnish her with an\u000aoccasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse\u000awith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\u000aElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\u000athe least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,\u000apretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters\u000ashe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\u000athem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\u000ahad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been\u000aher mother\u2019s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of\u000aher questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\u000aobserved,\u000a\u000a\u201cYour father\u2019s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your\u000asake,\u201d turning to Charlotte, \u201cI am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\u000aoccasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\u000anecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\u2019s family. Do you play and sing, Miss\u000aBennet?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA little.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\u000ainstrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it\u000asome day. Do your sisters play and sing?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne of them does.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\u000aWebbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\u000ayou draw?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat, none of you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot one.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\u000ashould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHas your governess left you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe never had any governess.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\u000awithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\u000ahave been quite a slave to your education.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been\u000athe case.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you\u000amust have been neglected.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCompared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\u000awished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\u000aread, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\u000aidle, certainly might.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had\u000aknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\u000aone. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\u000aand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\u000awonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\u000away. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\u000aof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\u000ait was but the other day that I recommended another young person,\u000awho was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\u000adelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf\u2019s\u000acalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. \u2018Lady\u000aCatherine,\u2019 said she, \u2018you have given me a treasure.\u2019 Are any of your\u000ayounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAll! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\u000ayounger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters\u000amust be very young?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be\u000amuch in company. But really, ma\u2019am, I think it would be very hard upon\u000ayounger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and\u000aamusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\u000amarry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\u000aas the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\u000anot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUpon my word,\u201d said her ladyship, \u201cyou give your opinion very decidedly\u000afor so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith three younger sisters grown up,\u201d replied Elizabeth, smiling, \u201cyour\u000aladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\u201d\u000a\u000aLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\u000aand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\u000adared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not\u000aconceal your age.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not one-and-twenty.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables\u000awere placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\u000adown to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\u000atwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\u000aparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\u000auttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\u000aexpressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh\u2019s being too hot or too cold, or\u000ahaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\u000aother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\u000aof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\u000awas employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her\u000afor every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\u000aSir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\u000aand noble names.\u000a\u000aWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\u000athe tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\u000agratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\u000around the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\u000ato have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by\u000athe arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\u000aCollins\u2019s side and as many bows on Sir William\u2019s they departed. As soon\u000aas they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin\u000ato give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for\u000aCharlotte\u2019s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her\u000acommendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy\u000aMr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship\u2019s praise\u000ainto his own hands.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 30\u000a\u000a\u000aSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long\u000aenough to convince him of his daughter\u2019s being most comfortably settled,\u000aand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\u000aoften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\u000amorning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but\u000awhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\u000aand Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\u000acousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast\u000aand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in\u000areading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,\u000awhich fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\u000aElizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer\u000athe dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a\u000amore pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent\u000areason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\u000amuch less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and\u000ashe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\u000a\u000aFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\u000awere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\u000aalong, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\u000awhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\u000aalmost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and\u000ahad a few minutes\u2019 conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\u000aprevailed upon to get out.\u000a\u000aVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\u000anot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\u000aand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\u000ato be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\u000ahours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,\u000aand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\u000athese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\u000aand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\u000aof the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\u000aaccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\u000aout that Mrs. Collins\u2019s joints of meat were too large for her family.\u000a\u000aElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\u000acommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate\u000ain her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her\u000aby Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to\u000abe quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\u000avillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\u000athem into harmony and plenty.\u000a\u000aThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\u000aand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\u000acard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\u000aof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\u000ain the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins\u2019s reach. This,\u000ahowever, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\u000acomfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with\u000aCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\u000aoften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she\u000afrequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\u000aalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\u000aa nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\u000awhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine\u2019s curiosity.\u000a\u000aIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\u000aEaster was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\u000aaddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\u000aimportant. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was\u000aexpected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not\u000amany of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would\u000afurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\u000ashe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\u2019s designs on him\u000awere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently\u000adestined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\u000asatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\u000aseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\u000aMiss Lucas and herself.\u000a\u000aHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\u000athe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\u000ain order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his\u000abow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\u000aintelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his\u000arespects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\u000aMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of\u000ahis uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when\u000aMr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen\u000athem from her husband\u2019s room, crossing the road, and immediately running\u000ainto the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:\u000a\u000a\u201cI may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\u000anever have come so soon to wait upon me.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,\u000abefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\u000aafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\u000awho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\u000aaddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\u000aused to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual\u000areserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\u000afriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\u000acurtseyed to him without saying a word.\u000a\u000aColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\u000areadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\u000ahis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\u000agarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\u000aAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\u000aElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\u000away, and after a moment\u2019s pause, added:\u000a\u000a\u201cMy eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\u000ahappened to see her there?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see\u000awhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between\u000athe Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he\u000aanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The\u000asubject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went\u000aaway.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 31\u000a\u000a\u000aColonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,\u000aand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures\u000aof their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they\u000areceived any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the\u000ahouse, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,\u000aalmost a week after the gentlemen\u2019s arrival, that they were honoured by\u000asuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\u000acome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little\u000aof Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the\u000aParsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen\u000aonly at church.\u000a\u000aThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined\u000athe party in Lady Catherine\u2019s drawing-room. Her ladyship received\u000athem civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\u000aacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\u000aalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\u000amuch more than to any other person in the room.\u000a\u000aColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a\u000awelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\u2019s pretty friend had\u000amoreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\u000atalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\u000aat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\u000awell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\u000aspirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,\u000aas well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\u000atowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a\u000awhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\u000ascruple to call out:\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\u000aof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are speaking of music, madam,\u201d said he, when no longer able to avoid\u000aa reply.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\u000amust have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.\u000aThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment\u000aof music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,\u000aI should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health\u000ahad allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed\u000adelightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\u2019s proficiency.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\u201d said Lady\u000aCatherine; \u201cand pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel\u000aif she does not practice a good deal.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI assure you, madam,\u201d he replied, \u201cthat she does not need such advice.\u000aShe practises very constantly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\u000ato her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\u000atell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\u000aconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she\u000awill never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\u000aCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\u000aher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\u000aJenkinson\u2019s room. She would be in nobody\u2019s way, you know, in that part\u000aof the house.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\u2019s ill-breeding, and made\u000ano answer.\u000a\u000aWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\u000apromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\u000adrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\u000atalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away\u000afrom her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte\u000astationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer\u2019s\u000acountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\u000aconvenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\u000ame? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There\u000ais a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the\u000awill of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate\u000ame.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI shall not say you are mistaken,\u201d he replied, \u201cbecause you could not\u000areally believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have\u000ahad the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find\u000agreat enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are\u000anot your own.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\u000aColonel Fitzwilliam, \u201cYour cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\u000ame, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\u000ain meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part\u000aof the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of\u000acredit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all\u000athat you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to\u000asay, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such\u000athings may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not afraid of you,\u201d said he, smilingly.\u000a\u000a\u201cPray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\u201d cried Colonel\u000aFitzwilliam. \u201cI should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.\u000aThe first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,\u000awas at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced\u000aonly four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain\u000aknowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a\u000apartner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\u000abeyond my own party.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTrue; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\u000aFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cI should have judged better, had I sought an\u000aintroduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\u201d said Elizabeth, still\u000aaddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \u201cShall we ask him why a man of sense and\u000aeducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend\u000ahimself to strangers?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can answer your question,\u201d said Fitzwilliam, \u201cwithout applying to\u000ahim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\u201d said Darcy,\u000a\u201cof conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\u000acatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\u000aconcerns, as I often see done.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy fingers,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cdo not move over this instrument in the\u000amasterly manner which I see so many women\u2019s do. They have not the same\u000aforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\u000ahave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the\u000atrouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as\u000acapable as any other woman\u2019s of superior execution.\u201d\u000a\u000aDarcy smiled and said, \u201cYou are perfectly right. You have employed your\u000atime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\u000athink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\u000awhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\u000aLady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\u000ato Darcy:\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\u000acould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\u000aof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne\u2019s. Anne would have\u000abeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his\u000acousin\u2019s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\u000adiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\u000ade Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\u000abeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\u000a\u000aLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\u2019s performance, mixing\u000awith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\u000athem with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the\u000agentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship\u2019s carriage was\u000aready to take them all home.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 32\u000a\u000a\u000aElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane\u000awhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,\u000awhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a\u000avisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to\u000abe Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her\u000ahalf-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,\u000awhen the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and\u000aMr. Darcy only, entered the room.\u000a\u000aHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his\u000aintrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were\u000ato be within.\u000a\u000aThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,\u000aseemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely\u000anecessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence\u000arecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and\u000afeeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\u000adeparture, she observed:\u000a\u000a\u201cHow very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\u000aIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\u000aall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\u000abefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerfectly so, I thank you.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short\u000apause added:\u000a\u000a\u201cI think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\u000areturning to Netherfield again?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\u000avery little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and\u000ais at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\u000aincreasing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for\u000athe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\u000amight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\u000anot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\u000afor his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same\u000aprinciple.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should not be surprised,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cif he were to give it up as\u000asoon as any eligible purchase offers.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\u000afriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\u000atrouble of finding a subject to him.\u000a\u000aHe took the hint, and soon began with, \u201cThis seems a very comfortable\u000ahouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\u000aCollins first came to Hunsford.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\u000akindness on a more grateful object.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one\u000aof the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\u000ahim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\u000aI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the\u000awisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a\u000aprudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\u000adistance of her own family and friends.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAn easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day\u2019s\u000ajourney. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\u000aof the match,\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cI should never have said Mrs. Collins\u000awas settled _near_ her family.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\u000athe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she\u000aunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\u000aNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\u000afamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\u000avarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of\u000atravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\u000acase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\u000asuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\u000afriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\u000athe present distance.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \u201c_You_ cannot\u000ahave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\u000abeen always at Longbourn.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\u000afeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and\u000aglancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you pleased with Kent?\u201d\u000a\u000aA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\u000acalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\u000aand her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised\u000athem. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding\u000aon Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying\u000amuch to anybody, went away.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat can be the meaning of this?\u201d said Charlotte, as soon as he was\u000agone. \u201cMy dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never\u000ahave called us in this familiar way.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,\u000aeven to Charlotte\u2019s wishes, to be the case; and after various\u000aconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\u000athe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\u000afrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\u000awas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot\u000aalways be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\u000apleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\u000atwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\u000aalmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\u000aseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\u000aaunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\u000ahad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\u000ahim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\u000abeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\u000aformer favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\u000athere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s manners,\u000ashe believed he might have the best informed mind.\u000a\u000aBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult\u000ato understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\u000aten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,\u000ait seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice\u000ato propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\u000aanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\u000aFitzwilliam\u2019s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\u000agenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\u000aher; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect\u000aof love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\u000aseriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at\u000aRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\u000acertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\u000alook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\u000adoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\u000aseemed nothing but absence of mind.\u000a\u000aShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\u000abeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\u000aCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\u000araising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\u000aopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend\u2019s dislike would\u000avanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\u000a\u000a\u000aIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\u000aColonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he\u000acertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\u000ato counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\u000ain the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 33\u000a\u000a\u000aMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\u000aunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\u000amischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to\u000aprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that\u000ait was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\u000atherefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like\u000awilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was\u000anot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\u000abut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\u000anever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\u000aor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\u000arencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about\u000aher pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\u000aopinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins\u2019s happiness; and that in speaking of\u000aRosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\u000aexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\u000a_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\u000aFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\u000amean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed\u000aher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\u000apales opposite the Parsonage.\u000a\u000aShe was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane\u2019s last letter,\u000aand dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in\u000aspirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw\u000aon looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the\u000aletter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:\u000a\u000a\u201cI did not know before that you ever walked this way.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have been making the tour of the park,\u201d he replied, \u201cas I generally\u000ado every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are\u000ayou going much farther?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I should have turned in a moment.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage\u000atogether.\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\u201d said she.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\u000aarranges the business just as he pleases.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\u000apleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\u000amore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe likes to have his own way very well,\u201d replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\u000a\u201cBut so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it\u000athan many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\u000afeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\u000adependence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\u000aeither. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\u000adependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\u000awherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\u000aexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\u000aweight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where\u000athey like.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUnless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\u000ado.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many\u000ain my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\u000amoney.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs this,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201cmeant for me?\u201d and she coloured at the\u000aidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \u201cAnd pray, what\u000ais the usual price of an earl\u2019s younger son? Unless the elder brother is\u000avery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\u000aa silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\u000ashe soon afterwards said:\u000a\u000a\u201cI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\u000ahaving someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\u000alasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\u000afor the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\u000alikes with her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \u201cthat is an advantage which he must\u000adivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your\u000acharge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a\u000alittle difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\u000amay like to have her own way.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\u000ain which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\u000agive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\u000agot pretty near the truth. She directly replied:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\u000asay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\u000avery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\u000aMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he\u000ais a great friend of Darcy\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! yes,\u201d said Elizabeth drily; \u201cMr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\u000aBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCare of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\u000athose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in\u000aour journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to\u000ahim. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\u000aBingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is it you mean?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,\u000abecause if it were to get round to the lady\u2019s family, it would be an\u000aunpleasant thing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou may depend upon my not mentioning it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\u000aBingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\u000aon having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\u000aimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\u000aparticulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing\u000ahim the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\u000aknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI understood that there were some very strong objections against the\u000alady.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd what arts did he use to separate them?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe did not talk to me of his own arts,\u201d said Fitzwilliam, smiling. \u201cHe\u000aonly told me what I have now told you.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\u000aindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\u000awas so thoughtful.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am thinking of what you have been telling me,\u201d said she. \u201cYour\u000acousin\u2019s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\u000afriend\u2019s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to\u000adetermine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.\u000aBut,\u201d she continued, recollecting herself, \u201cas we know none of the\u000aparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\u000athat there was much affection in the case.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is not an unnatural surmise,\u201d said Fitzwilliam, \u201cbut it is a\u000alessening of the honour of my cousin\u2019s triumph very sadly.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\u000aof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and\u000atherefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent\u000amatters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\u000aas soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\u000aof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\u000apeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\u000acould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\u000asuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\u000ataken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\u000aalways attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement\u000aof them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was\u000athe cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had\u000asuffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while\u000aevery hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the\u000aworld; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere were some very strong objections against the lady,\u201d were Colonel\u000aFitzwilliam\u2019s words; and those strong objections probably were, her\u000ahaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\u000abusiness in London.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo Jane herself,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cthere could be no possibility of\u000aobjection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding\u000aexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither\u000acould anything be urged against my father, who, though with some\u000apeculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and\u000arespectability which he will probably never reach.\u201d When she thought of\u000aher mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow\u000athat any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\u000apride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of\u000aimportance in his friend\u2019s connections, than from their want of sense;\u000aand she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed\u000aby this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.\u000aBingley for his sister.\u000a\u000aThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a\u000aheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to\u000aher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\u000acousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\u000aseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much\u000aas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\u000acould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\u2019s being rather\u000adispleased by her staying at home.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 34\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself\u000aas much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\u000aexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\u000abeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\u000arevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\u000aBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\u000acheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,\u000aproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\u000adisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\u000anoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\u000aattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy\u2019s\u000ashameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her\u000aa keener sense of her sister\u2019s sufferings. It was some consolation\u000ato think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the\u000anext--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should\u000aherself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of\u000aher spirits, by all that affection could do.\u000a\u000aShe could not think of Darcy\u2019s leaving Kent without remembering that\u000ahis cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\u000athat he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not\u000amean to be unhappy about him.\u000a\u000aWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\u000adoor-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\u000abeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\u000athe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.\u000aBut this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\u000aaffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\u000aroom. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\u000ahealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\u000aShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\u000athen getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\u000asaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\u000ain an agitated manner, and thus began:\u000a\u000a\u201cIn vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\u000arepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\u000ayou.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth\u2019s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\u000adoubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;\u000aand the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,\u000aimmediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides\u000athose of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the\u000asubject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of\u000aits being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always\u000aopposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to\u000athe consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\u000asuit.\u000a\u000aIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\u000athe compliment of such a man\u2019s affection, and though her intentions did\u000anot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\u000areceive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she\u000alost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\u000aanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\u000arepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite\u000aof all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with\u000aexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\u000ahis hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt\u000aof a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but\u000ahis countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could\u000aonly exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her\u000acheeks, and she said:\u000a\u000a\u201cIn such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\u000aexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\u000aunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should\u000abe felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\u000acannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\u000abestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\u000aanyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\u000aof short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\u000athe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in\u000aovercoming it after this explanation.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed\u000aon her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\u000asurprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance\u000aof his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\u000aappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\u000ahimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth\u2019s feelings\u000adreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!\u000aI might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\u000acivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI might as well inquire,\u201d replied she, \u201cwhy with so evident a desire\u000aof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\u000aagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\u000aWas not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\u000aother provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against\u000ayou--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you\u000athink that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\u000abeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most\u000abeloved sister?\u201d\u000a\u000aAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\u000awas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\u000acontinued:\u000a\u000a\u201cI have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\u000aexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\u000ayou cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means\u000aof dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the\u000aworld for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for\u000adisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\u000akind.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\u000awith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\u000aHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\u000a\u000a\u201cCan you deny that you have done it?\u201d she repeated.\u000a\u000aWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \u201cI have no wish of denying\u000athat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\u000asister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\u000akinder than towards myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\u000abut its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut it is not merely this affair,\u201d she continued, \u201con which my dislike\u000ais founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was\u000adecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\u000amany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\u000asay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\u000aor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou take an eager interest in that gentleman\u2019s concerns,\u201d said Darcy,\u000ain a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\u000a\u000a\u201cWho that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an\u000ainterest in him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHis misfortunes!\u201d repeated Darcy contemptuously; \u201cyes, his misfortunes\u000ahave been great indeed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd of your infliction,\u201d cried Elizabeth with energy. \u201cYou have reduced\u000ahim to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have\u000awithheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for\u000ahim. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence\u000awhich was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!\u000aand yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and\u000aridicule.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd this,\u201d cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\u000a\u201cis your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!\u000aI thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\u000acalculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\u201d added he, stopping in\u000ahis walk, and turning towards her, \u201cthese offenses might have been\u000aoverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\u000ascruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\u000abitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\u000apolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of\u000amy being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\u000areflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\u000aNor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and\u000ajust. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\u000aconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose\u000acondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\u000athe utmost to speak with composure when she said:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\u000adeclaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern\u000awhich I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more\u000agentlemanlike manner.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that\u000awould have tempted me to accept it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\u000aexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of\u000amy acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest\u000abelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of\u000athe feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of\u000adisapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\u000adislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\u000alast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\u000afeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\u000aForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\u000awishes for your health and happiness.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\u000athe next moment open the front door and quit the house.\u000a\u000aThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how\u000ato support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for\u000ahalf-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,\u000awas increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of\u000amarriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for\u000aso many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of\u000aall the objections which had made him prevent his friend\u2019s marrying\u000aher sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his\u000aown case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired\u000aunconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable\u000apride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to\u000aJane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could\u000anot justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.\u000aWickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon\u000aovercame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for\u000aa moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the\u000asound of Lady Catherine\u2019s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to\u000aencounter Charlotte\u2019s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 35\u000a\u000a\u000aElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\u000awhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\u000asurprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything\u000aelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after\u000abreakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\u000adirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\u2019s\u000asometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\u000ashe turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The\u000apark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\u000aof the gates into the ground.\u000a\u000aAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\u000atempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\u000alook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\u000amade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\u000averdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,\u000awhen she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\u000aedged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.\u000aDarcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now\u000anear enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\u000aher name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though\u000ain a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the\u000agate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,\u000awhich she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,\u000a\u201cI have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.\u000aWill you do me the honour of reading that letter?\u201d And then, with a\u000aslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\u000a\u000aWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\u000aElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\u000aperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written\u000aquite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\u000afull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\u000afrom Rosings, at eight o\u2019clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\u000a\u000a\u201cBe not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension\u000aof its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those\u000aoffers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\u000aintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes\u000awhich, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\u000aeffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\u000ashould have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\u000aand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\u000ayour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\u000ademand it of your justice.\u000a\u000a\u201cTwo offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\u000amagnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\u000athat, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\u000afrom your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\u000aclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\u000aprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\u000awantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\u000afavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\u000adependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\u000aits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\u000apersons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\u000abear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\u000anight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\u000ato be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions\u000aand their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which\u000ais due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\u000amay be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity\u000amust be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\u000aothers, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young\u000awoman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance\u000aat Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious\u000aattachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I\u000ahad the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir\u000aWilliam Lucas\u2019s accidental information, that Bingley\u2019s attentions to\u000ayour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.\u000aHe spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could\u000abe undecided. From that moment I observed my friend\u2019s behaviour\u000aattentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss\u000aBennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also\u000awatched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,\u000abut without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced\u000afrom the evening\u2019s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions\u000awith pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\u000asentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been\u000ain error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter\u000aprobable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict\u000apain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not\u000ascruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister\u2019s countenance and\u000aair was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction\u000athat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be\u000aeasily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is\u000acertain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions\u000aare not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe\u000aher to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial\u000aconviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the\u000amarriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have\u000athe utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of\u000aconnection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But\u000athere were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still\u000aexisting, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had\u000amyself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before\u000ame. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your\u000amother\u2019s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that\u000atotal want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by\u000aherself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your\u000afather. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern\u000afor the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\u000arepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to\u000ahave conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,\u000ais praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than\u000ait is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say\u000afarther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties\u000awas confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led\u000ame before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\u000aconnection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as\u000ayou, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters\u2019 uneasiness\u000ahad been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was\u000asoon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in\u000adetaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in\u000aLondon. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office\u000aof pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I\u000adescribed, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance\u000amight have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\u000athat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\u000aseconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your\u000asister\u2019s indifference. He had before believed her to return his\u000aaffection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\u000anatural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his\u000aown. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was\u000ano very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into\u000aHertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the\u000awork of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There\u000ais but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not\u000areflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the\u000ameasures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister\u2019s being in\u000atown. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her\u000abrother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without\u000aill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me\u000aenough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this\u000aconcealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it\u000awas done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no\u000aother apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister\u2019s feelings, it\u000awas unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to\u000ayou very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn\u000athem.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured\u000aMr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his\u000aconnection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I\u000aam ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more\u000athan one witness of undoubted veracity.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many\u000ayears the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good\u000aconduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to\u000abe of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his\u000akindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at\u000aschool, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his\u000aown father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have\u000abeen unable to give him a gentleman\u2019s education. My father was not only\u000afond of this young man\u2019s society, whose manners were always engaging; he\u000ahad also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be\u000ahis profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is\u000amany, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different\u000amanner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was\u000acareful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape\u000athe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,\u000aand who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.\u000aDarcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree\u000ayou only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham\u000ahas created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from\u000aunfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to\u000aMr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly\u000arecommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner\u000athat his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a\u000avaluable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There\u000awas also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long\u000asurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham\u000awrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,\u000ahe hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more\u000aimmediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he\u000acould not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying\u000alaw, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would\u000abe a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed\u000ahim to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to\u000ahis proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the\u000abusiness was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance\u000ain the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\u000areceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\u000abetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\u000ato Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly\u000alived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free\u000afrom all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.\u000aFor about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\u000aincumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to\u000ame again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured\u000ame, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He\u000ahad found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\u000aresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in\u000aquestion--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was\u000awell assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not\u000ahave forgotten my revered father\u2019s intentions. You will hardly blame\u000ame for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every\u000arepetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of\u000ahis circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\u000ato others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every\u000aappearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But\u000alast summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\u000a\u000a\u201cI must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,\u000aand which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold\u000ato any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your\u000asecrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to\u000athe guardianship of my mother\u2019s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.\u000aAbout a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed\u000afor her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided\u000aover it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by\u000adesign; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him\u000aand Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and\u000aby her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,\u000awhose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to\u000aher as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and\u000ato consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her\u000aexcuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed\u000athe knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two\u000abefore the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the\u000aidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as\u000aa father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and\u000ahow I acted. Regard for my sister\u2019s credit and feelings prevented\u000aany public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place\u000aimmediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.\u000aWickham\u2019s chief object was unquestionably my sister\u2019s fortune, which\u000ais thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of\u000arevenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have\u000abeen complete indeed.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have\u000abeen concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as\u000afalse, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.\u000aWickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he\u000ahad imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered\u000aat. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,\u000adetection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in\u000ayour inclination.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but\u000aI was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to\u000abe revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more\u000aparticularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our\u000anear relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of\u000athe executors of my father\u2019s will, has been unavoidably acquainted\u000awith every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_\u000ashould make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by\u000athe same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be\u000athe possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some\u000aopportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the\u000amorning. I will only add, God bless you.\u000a\u000a\u201cFITZWILLIAM DARCY\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 36\u000a\u000a\u000aIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\u000acontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\u000aits contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly\u000ashe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\u000aHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\u000ashe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\u000aand steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\u000ato give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\u000aprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what\u000ahad happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly\u000aleft her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the\u000anext sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of\u000athe one before her eyes. His belief of her sister\u2019s insensibility she\u000ainstantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst\u000aobjections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing\u000ahim justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied\u000aher; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and\u000ainsolence.\u000a\u000aBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\u000ashe read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,\u000aif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\u000abore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her\u000afeelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\u000aAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\u000ato discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \u201cThis must be false!\u000aThis cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!\u201d--and when she had\u000agone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the\u000alast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\u000aregard it, that she would never look in it again.\u000a\u000aIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\u000anothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter\u000awas unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she\u000aagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\u000acommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\u000aThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what\u000ahe had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though\u000ashe had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own\u000awords. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the\u000awill, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\u000awas fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\u000aimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\u000aother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\u000anot err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the\u000aparticulars immediately following of Wickham\u2019s resigning all pretensions\u000ato the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\u000athousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down\u000athe letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\u000aimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\u000alittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read\u000aon; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\u000abelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\u000arender Mr. Darcy\u2019s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\u000aturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\u000a\u000aThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at\u000aMr. Wickham\u2019s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\u000abring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\u000aentrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the\u000apersuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\u000ahad there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life\u000anothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As\u000ato his real character, had information been in her power, she had\u000anever felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had\u000aestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried\u000ato recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of\u000aintegrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of\u000aMr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those\u000acasual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy\u000ahad described as the idleness and vice of many years\u2019 continuance. But\u000ano such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before\u000aher, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more\u000asubstantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and\u000athe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After\u000apausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to\u000aread. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss\u000aDarcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel\u000aFitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was\u000areferred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam\u000ahimself--from whom she had previously received the information of his\u000anear concern in all his cousin\u2019s affairs, and whose character she had no\u000areason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to\u000ahim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and\u000aat length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never\u000ahave hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\u000acousin\u2019s corroboration.\u000a\u000aShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation\u000abetween Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips\u2019s.\u000aMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\u000astruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\u000awondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\u000ahimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\u000awith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\u000aof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\u000a_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\u000athe very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield\u000afamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\u000aherself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;\u000athat he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\u2019s\u000acharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\u000aalways prevent his exposing the son.\u000a\u000aHow differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!\u000aHis attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\u000ahatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\u000athe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\u000aHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had\u000aeither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\u000ahis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\u000aincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\u000aand fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\u000abut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\u000aasserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as\u000awere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\u000aacquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\u000atogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\u000athat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\u000aof irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was\u000aesteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\u000abrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\u000asister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his\u000aactions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\u000aeverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\u000athat friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man\u000aas Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\u000a\u000aShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\u000acould she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,\u000aabsurd.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow despicably I have acted!\u201d she cried; \u201cI, who have prided myself\u000aon my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have\u000aoften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified\u000amy vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this\u000adiscovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could\u000anot have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my\u000afolly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\u000aof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\u000aprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were\u000aconcerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrom herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\u000awhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy\u2019s explanation\u000a_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely\u000adifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\u000acredit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to\u000agive in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her\u000asister\u2019s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte\u2019s\u000aopinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his\u000adescription of Jane. She felt that Jane\u2019s feelings, though fervent, were\u000alittle displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air\u000aand manner not often united with great sensibility.\u000a\u000aWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\u000amentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense\u000aof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\u000afor denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as\u000ahaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\u000adisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\u000athan on hers.\u000a\u000aThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,\u000abut it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been\u000aself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered\u000athat Jane\u2019s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest\u000arelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\u000aby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\u000ahad ever known before.\u000a\u000aAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\u000avariety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,\u000aand reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and\u000aso important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made\u000aher at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish\u000aof appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such\u000areflections as must make her unfit for conversation.\u000a\u000aShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\u000acalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take\u000aleave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\u000aan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\u000atill she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern\u000ain missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\u000alonger an object; she could think only of her letter.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 37\u000a\u000a\u000aThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having\u000abeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\u000aable to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very\u000agood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\u000amelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then\u000ahastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\u000abrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,\u000aimporting that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\u000ahaving them all to dine with her.\u000a\u000aElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had\u000ashe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as\u000aher future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\u000aladyship\u2019s indignation would have been. \u201cWhat would she have said? how\u000awould she have behaved?\u201d were questions with which she amused herself.\u000a\u000aTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. \u201cI assure\u000ayou, I feel it exceedingly,\u201d said Lady Catherine; \u201cI believe no one\u000afeels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly\u000aattached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to\u000ame! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The\u000adear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy\u000aseemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His\u000aattachment to Rosings certainly increases.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which\u000awere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\u000a\u000aLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\u000aspirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that\u000ashe did not like to go home again so soon, she added:\u000a\u000a\u201cBut if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that\u000ayou may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your\u000acompany, I am sure.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,\u201d replied\u000aElizabeth, \u201cbut it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town\u000anext Saturday.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected\u000ayou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There\u000acan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly\u000aspare you for another fortnight.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters\u000aare never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay\u000aanother _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as\u000afar as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as\u000aDawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room\u000afor one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I\u000ashould not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\u000aoriginal plan.\u201d\u000a\u000aLady Catherine seemed resigned. \u201cMrs. Collins, you must send a servant\u000awith them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea\u000aof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.\u000aYou must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in\u000athe world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly\u000aguarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my\u000aniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\u000ahaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of\u000aMr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\u000apropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\u000athings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I\u000aam glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be\u000adiscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy uncle is to send a servant for us.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you\u000ahave somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?\u000aOh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be\u000aattended to.\u201d\u000a\u000aLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,\u000aand as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,\u000awhich Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so\u000aoccupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be\u000areserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it\u000aas the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary\u000awalk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant\u000arecollections.\u000a\u000aMr. Darcy\u2019s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She\u000astudied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\u000atimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\u000ashe was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly\u000ashe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\u000aherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\u000aHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she\u000acould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,\u000aor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\u000abehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in\u000athe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\u000aThey were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\u000athem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\u000ayoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\u000aherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently\u000aunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\u000aand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother\u2019s indulgence,\u000awhat chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\u000airritable, and completely under Lydia\u2019s guidance, had been always\u000aaffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\u000ascarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While\u000athere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\u000aMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there\u000aforever.\u000a\u000aAnxiety on Jane\u2019s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy\u2019s\u000aexplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,\u000aheightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved\u000ato have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any\u000acould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How\u000agrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every\u000arespect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\u000abeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\u000a\u000aWhen to these recollections was added the development of Wickham\u2019s\u000acharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\u000aseldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it\u000aalmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\u000a\u000aTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of\u000aher stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent\u000athere; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of\u000atheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,\u000aand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right\u000away, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the\u000awork of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\u000a\u000aWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them\u000aa good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;\u000aand Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her\u000ahand to both.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 38\u000a\u000a\u000aOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few\u000aminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of\u000apaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know not, Miss Elizabeth,\u201d said he, \u201cwhether Mrs. Collins has yet\u000aexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very\u000acertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for\u000ait. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We\u000aknow how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain\u000amanner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we\u000asee of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like\u000ayourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,\u000aand that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending\u000ayour time unpleasantly.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She\u000ahad spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with\u000aCharlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_\u000afeel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling\u000asolemnity replied:\u000a\u000a\u201cIt gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not\u000adisagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately\u000ahaving it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,\u000afrom our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the\u000ahumble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford\u000avisit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to\u000aLady Catherine\u2019s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage\u000aand blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You\u000asee how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge\u000athat, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should\u000anot think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are\u000asharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\u201d\u000a\u000aWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was\u000aobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility\u000aand truth in a few short sentences.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\u000aHertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will\u000abe able to do so. Lady Catherine\u2019s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you\u000ahave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear\u000athat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be\u000aas well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,\u000athat I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in\u000amarriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of\u000athinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of\u000acharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each\u000aother.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was\u000athe case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed\u000aand rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to\u000ahave the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.\u000aPoor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she\u000ahad chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that\u000aher visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her\u000ahome and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their\u000adependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\u000a\u000aAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels\u000aplaced within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate\u000aparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by\u000aMr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her\u000awith his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks\u000afor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his\u000acompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her\u000ain, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,\u000awhen he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\u000ahitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cyou will of course wish to have your humble respects\u000adelivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you\u000awhile you have been here.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and\u000athe carriage drove off.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood gracious!\u201d cried Maria, after a few minutes\u2019 silence, \u201cit seems\u000abut a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have\u000ahappened!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA great many indeed,\u201d said her companion with a sigh.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!\u000aHow much I shall have to tell!\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth added privately, \u201cAnd how much I shall have to conceal!\u201d\u000a\u000aTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and\u000awithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner\u2019s\u000ahouse, where they were to remain a few days.\u000a\u000aJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her\u000aspirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her\u000aaunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at\u000aLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\u000a\u000aIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for\u000aLongbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\u2019s proposals. To know\u000athat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish\u000aJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own\u000avanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation\u000ato openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision\u000ain which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;\u000aand her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried\u000ainto repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister\u000afurther.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 39\u000a\u000a\u000aIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out\u000atogether from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;\u000aand, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet\u2019s carriage\u000awas to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman\u2019s\u000apunctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.\u000aThese two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed\u000ain visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and\u000adressing a salad and cucumber.\u000a\u000aAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set\u000aout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,\u000a\u201cIs not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd we mean to treat you all,\u201d added Lydia, \u201cbut you must lend us the\u000amoney, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.\u201d Then, showing\u000aher purchases--\u201cLook here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think\u000ait is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall\u000apull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any\u000abetter.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\u000aunconcern, \u201cOh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\u000awhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\u000athink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\u000aone wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\u000aare going in a fortnight.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAre they indeed!\u201d cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to\u000atake us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;\u000aand I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to\u000ago too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall\u000ahave!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201c_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,\u000aand completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole\u000acampful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor\u000aregiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow I have got some news for you,\u201d said Lydia, as they sat down at\u000atable. \u201cWhat do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about\u000aa certain person we all like!\u201d\u000a\u000aJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need\u000anot stay. Lydia laughed, and said:\u000a\u000a\u201cAye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the\u000awaiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse\u000athings said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\u000ahe is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\u000amy news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?\u000aThere is no danger of Wickham\u2019s marrying Mary King. There\u2019s for you! She\u000ais gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd Mary King is safe!\u201d added Elizabeth; \u201csafe from a connection\u000aimprudent as to fortune.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\u201d said Jane.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared\u000athree straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled\u000athing?\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\u000acoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_\u000awas little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!\u000a\u000aAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\u000aordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\u000aboxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty\u2019s and\u000aLydia\u2019s purchases, were seated in it.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow nicely we are all crammed in,\u201d cried Lydia. \u201cI am glad I bought my\u000abonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now\u000alet us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way\u000ahome. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all\u000asince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\u000aflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\u000abefore you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\u000aShe is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not\u000abeing married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to\u000aget husbands, you can\u2019t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\u000aCollins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\u000ahow I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would\u000achaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\u000aof fun the other day at Colonel Forster\u2019s. Kitty and me were to spend\u000athe day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\u000aevening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\u000ashe asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\u000awas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\u000adressed up Chamberlayne in woman\u2019s clothes on purpose to pass for a\u000alady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\u000aForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\u000aone of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\u000aand Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\u000adid not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.\u000aForster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\u000asomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\u000aLydia, assisted by Kitty\u2019s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\u000acompanions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\u000acould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham\u2019s name.\u000a\u000aTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\u000ain undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\u000asay voluntarily to Elizabeth:\u000a\u000a\u201cI am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\u201d\u000a\u000aTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\u000acame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that\u000aoccupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and\u000apoultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one\u000ahand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat\u000asome way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger\u000aLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person\u2019s,\u000awas enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who\u000awould hear her.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! Mary,\u201d said she, \u201cI wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\u000aAs we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there\u000awas nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty\u000ahad not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved\u000avery handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold\u000aluncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated\u000ayou too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never\u000ashould have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then\u000awe were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that\u000aanybody might have heard us ten miles off!\u201d\u000a\u000aTo this Mary very gravely replied, \u201cFar be it from me, my dear sister,\u000ato depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the\u000agenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\u000a_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\u000aanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\u000a\u000aIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk\u000ato Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily\u000aopposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could\u000anot be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.\u000aThere was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.\u000aWickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The\u000acomfort to _her_ of the regiment\u2019s approaching removal was indeed beyond\u000aexpression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped\u000athere could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\u000a\u000aShe had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton\u000ascheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\u000afrequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\u000afather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\u000aat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\u000adisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 40\u000a\u000a\u000aElizabeth\u2019s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could\u000ano longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every\u000aparticular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be\u000asurprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene\u000abetween Mr. Darcy and herself.\u000a\u000aMiss Bennet\u2019s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly\u000apartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly\u000anatural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was\u000asorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\u000alittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\u000aunhappiness which her sister\u2019s refusal must have given him.\u000a\u000a\u201cHis being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\u201d said she, \u201cand certainly\u000aought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his\u000adisappointment!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cI am heartily sorry for him; but he has\u000aother feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\u000aYou do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBlame you! Oh, no.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next\u000aday.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\u000aas they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!\u000awho would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\u000aso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here\u000acollected in one individual. Nor was Darcy\u2019s vindication, though\u000agrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\u000aMost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\u000aseek to clear the one without involving the other.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis will not do,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cyou never will be able to make both\u000aof them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\u000awith only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\u000aenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\u000aabout pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\u2019s;\u000abut you shall do as you choose.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not know when I have been more shocked,\u201d said she. \u201cWickham so\u000avery bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only\u000aconsider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the\u000aknowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing\u000aof his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it\u000aso.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so\u000afull of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am\u000agrowing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion\u000amakes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will\u000abe as light as a feather.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPoor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\u000acountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\u000atwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the\u000aappearance of it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\u000aused to do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\u000ato him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one\u2019s genius, such an\u000aopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\u000aabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing\u000aat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\u000athe matter as you do now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And\u000awith no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say\u000athat I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I\u000ahad! Oh! how I wanted you!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\u000ain speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\u000aundeserved.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCertainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\u000anatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There\u000ais one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\u000aought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand\u000aWickham\u2019s character.\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \u201cSurely there can be no\u000aoccasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me\u000ato make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\u000arelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\u000amyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\u000aconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy\u000ais so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in\u000aMeryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal\u000ato it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\u000aanyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,\u000aand then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At\u000apresent I will say nothing about it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\u000aever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\u000are-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe tumult of Elizabeth\u2019s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had\u000agot rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,\u000aand was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish\u000ato talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,\u000aof which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other\u000ahalf of Mr. Darcy\u2019s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she\u000ahad been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one\u000acould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\u000aunderstanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off\u000athis last encumbrance of mystery. \u201cAnd then,\u201d said she, \u201cif that very\u000aimprobable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to\u000atell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The\u000aliberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!\u201d\u000a\u000aShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real\u000astate of her sister\u2019s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a\u000avery tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself\u000ain love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,\u000aand, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first\u000aattachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,\u000aand prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her\u000aattention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the\u000aindulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own\u000ahealth and their tranquillity.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, Lizzy,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet one day, \u201cwhat is your opinion _now_ of\u000athis sad business of Jane\u2019s? For my part, I am determined never to speak\u000aof it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But\u000aI cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is\u000aa very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there\u2019s the least\u000achance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of\u000ahis coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of\u000aeverybody, too, who is likely to know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I\u000ashall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I\u000awould not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will\u000adie of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,\u000ashe made no answer.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, Lizzy,\u201d continued her mother, soon afterwards, \u201cand so the\u000aCollinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope\u000ait will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an\u000aexcellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her\u000amother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_\u000ahousekeeping, I dare say.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, nothing at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will\u000atake care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed\u000afor money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often\u000atalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as\u000aquite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was a subject which they could not mention before me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they\u000aoften talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an\u000aestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be\u000aashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 41\u000a\u000a\u000aThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was\u000athe last of the regiment\u2019s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies\u000ain the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\u000auniversal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\u000aand sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very\u000afrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and\u000aLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\u000ahard-heartedness in any of the family.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?\u201d would they\u000aoften exclaim in the bitterness of woe. \u201cHow can you be smiling so,\u000aLizzy?\u201d\u000a\u000aTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what\u000ashe had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years\u000aago.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sure,\u201d said she, \u201cI cried for two days together when Colonel\u000aMiller\u2019s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sure I shall break _mine_,\u201d said Lydia.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf one could but go to Brighton!\u201d observed Mrs. Bennet.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so\u000adisagreeable.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\u201d\u000a added Kitty.\u000a\u000aSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\u000aLongbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense\u000aof pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy\u2019s\u000aobjections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his\u000ainterference in the views of his friend.\u000a\u000aBut the gloom of Lydia\u2019s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she\u000areceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of\u000athe regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a\u000avery young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour\u000aand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\u000atheir _three_ months\u2019 acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\u000a\u000aThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\u000athe delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\u000ato be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\u2019s feelings, Lydia\u000aflew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone\u2019s\u000acongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\u000awhilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate\u000ain terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\u201d\u000a said she, \u201cThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much\u000aright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make\u000aher resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from\u000aexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\u000aconsidered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense\u000afor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it\u000aknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\u000ago. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\u2019s general\u000abehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\u000asuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\u000aimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\u000abe greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:\u000a\u000a\u201cLydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public\u000aplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so\u000alittle expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present\u000acircumstances.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you were aware,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cof the very great disadvantage to\u000aus all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\u2019s unguarded and\u000aimprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you\u000awould judge differently in the affair.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAlready arisen?\u201d repeated Mr. Bennet. \u201cWhat, has she frightened away\u000asome of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such\u000asqueamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity\u000aare not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who\u000ahave been kept aloof by Lydia\u2019s folly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\u000aof particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\u000aimportance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the\u000awild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\u000aLydia\u2019s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\u000afather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\u000aof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\u000aher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\u000awill be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\u000athat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\u000aworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\u000ayouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness\u000aof her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\u000acontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger\u000aKitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\u000aignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you\u000asuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\u000athey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\u000adisgrace?\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\u000aaffectionately taking her hand said in reply:\u000a\u000a\u201cDo not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known\u000ayou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\u000aadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\u000asisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\u000aBrighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\u000akeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\u000aobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\u000aeven as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\u000awomen better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\u000athere may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\u000amany degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest\u000aof her life.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\u000acontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\u000ain her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on\u000athem. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret\u000aover unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\u000adisposition.\u000a\u000aHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\u000afather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\u000aunited volubility. In Lydia\u2019s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\u000aevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye\u000aof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\u000aShe saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them\u000aat present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents\u000astretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\u000aand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\u000asaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\u000aofficers at once.\u000a\u000aHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such\u000arealities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have\u000abeen understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.\u000aLydia\u2019s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy\u000aconviction of her husband\u2019s never intending to go there himself.\u000a\u000aBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\u000acontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia\u2019s leaving\u000ahome.\u000a\u000aElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\u000afrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\u000awell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\u000alearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted\u000aher, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\u000abehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\u000afor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\u000ahad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\u000awhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\u000afinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\u000agallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\u000areproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\u000acause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\u000aand her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\u000a\u000aOn the very last day of the regiment\u2019s remaining at Meryton, he dined,\u000awith other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\u000adisposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some\u000ainquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\u000amentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s and Mr. Darcy\u2019s having both spent three\u000aweeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\u000a\u000aHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\u2019s\u000arecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\u000ahim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\u000aasked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\u000aWith an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:\u000a\u000a\u201cHow long did you say he was at Rosings?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNearly three weeks.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd you saw him frequently?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, almost every day.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHis manners are very different from his cousin\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed!\u201d cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. \u201cAnd\u000apray, may I ask?--\u201d But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, \u201cIs\u000ait in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility\u000ato his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,\u201d he continued in a lower\u000aand more serious tone, \u201cthat he is improved in essentials.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, no!\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cIn essentials, I believe, he is very much\u000awhat he ever was.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\u000arejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a\u000asomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\u000aand anxious attention, while she added:\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\u000ahis mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from\u000aknowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\u201d\u000a\u000aWickham\u2019s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\u000alook; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his\u000aembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\u000aaccents:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\u000acomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\u000aeven the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\u000amay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only\u000adeter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only\u000afear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been\u000aalluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good\u000aopinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always\u000aoperated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be\u000aimputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I\u000aam certain he has very much at heart.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\u000aslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\u000athe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\u000ahim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his\u000aside, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\u000aElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\u000amutual desire of never meeting again.\u000a\u000aWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,\u000afrom whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation\u000abetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the\u000aonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\u000aBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,\u000aand impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the\u000aopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which\u000athere was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in\u000athe clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more\u000agentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 42\u000a\u000a\u000aHad Elizabeth\u2019s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could\u000anot have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic\u000acomfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance\u000aof good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a\u000awoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\u000atheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\u000aesteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views\u000aof domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of\u000aa disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\u000aimprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often\u000aconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\u000athe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\u000aenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as\u000aher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not\u000athe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his\u000awife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true\u000aphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\u000a\u000aElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her\u000afather\u2019s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but\u000arespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\u000aherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\u000abanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\u000aand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\u000achildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\u000astrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\u000aunsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\u000afrom so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,\u000amight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\u000aif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\u000a\u000aWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\u2019s departure she found little\u000aother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\u000aabroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and\u000asister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around\u000athem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty\u000amight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers\u000aof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition\u000agreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all\u000aher folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\u000awatering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\u000ahas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been\u000alooking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the\u000asatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\u000aname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have\u000asome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\u000aagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\u000apresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\u000awas now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\u000afor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\u000aand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\u000ascheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut it is fortunate,\u201d thought she, \u201cthat I have something to wish for.\u000aWere the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\u000aBut here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my\u000asister\u2019s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\u000apleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\u000anever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\u000athe defence of some little peculiar vexation.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\u000ato her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\u000aalways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\u000athey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\u000ahad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\u000amade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\u000ashe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\u000aviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to\u000athe camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still\u000aless to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were\u000amuch too full of lines under the words to be made public.\u000a\u000aAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good\u000ahumour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore\u000aa happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came\u000aback again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet\u000awas restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of\u000aJune, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without\u000atears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by\u000athe following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to\u000amention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious\u000aarrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in\u000aMeryton.\u000a\u000aThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\u000aapproaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\u000aarrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\u000acurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\u000asetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\u000awithin a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so\u000afar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\u000athe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\u000athe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the\u000apresent plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that\u000acounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\u000aweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\u000atown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\u000athey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\u000aher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\u000aDovedale, or the Peak.\u000a\u000aElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing\u000athe Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\u000awas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\u000aand all was soon right again.\u000a\u000aWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was\u000aimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\u000aowner. \u201cBut surely,\u201d said she, \u201cI may enter his county with impunity,\u000aand rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\u000abefore her uncle and aunt\u2019s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.\u000aand Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\u000aLongbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\u000ayounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their\u000acousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\u000asweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\u000away--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\u000a\u000aThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the\u000anext morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.\u000aOne enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;\u000aa suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\u000ainconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\u000aand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\u000adisappointments abroad.\u000a\u000aIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\u000anor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\u000alay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are\u000asufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\u000aconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s\u000aformer residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance\u000astill remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the\u000aprincipal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,\u000aElizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not\u000ain their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\u000atalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed\u000aan inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\u000awillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard\u000aso much?\u201d said her aunt; \u201ca place, too, with which so many of your\u000aacquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\u000aknow.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\u000aPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\u000amust own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so\u000amany, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \u201cIf it were merely a fine house\u000arichly furnished,\u201d said she, \u201cI should not care about it myself; but\u000athe grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\u000acountry.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The\u000apossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\u000aoccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and\u000athought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such\u000aa risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\u000athat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the\u000aabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.\u000a\u000aAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\u000awhether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its\u000aproprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\u000athe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her\u000aalarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\u000acuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\u000anext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\u000awith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\u000ato the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 43\u000a\u000a\u000aElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\u000aPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\u000ain at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\u000a\u000aThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\u000aentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\u000aa beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\u000a\u000aElizabeth\u2019s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\u000aevery remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\u000ahalf-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\u000aeminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\u000aPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which\u000athe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\u000abuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of\u000ahigh woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was\u000aswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\u000awere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\u000ahad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\u000abeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\u000aall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\u000ato be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\u000a\u000aThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\u000awhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\u000ameeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\u000amistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\u000ahall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\u000awonder at her being where she was.\u000a\u000aThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less\u000afine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\u000afollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned\u000aroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\u000ato a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which\u000athey had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\u000awas a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and\u000ashe looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its\u000abanks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,\u000awith delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking\u000adifferent positions; but from every window there were beauties to be\u000aseen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to\u000athe fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of\u000ahis taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\u000asplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd of this place,\u201d thought she, \u201cI might have been mistress! With\u000athese rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\u000aviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\u000awelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,\u201d--recollecting\u000aherself--\u201cthat could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\u000ame; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like\u000aregret.\u000a\u000aShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really\u000aabsent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question\u000awas asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.\u000aReynolds replied that he was, adding, \u201cBut we expect him to-morrow, with\u000aa large party of friends.\u201d How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own\u000ajourney had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\u000a\u000aHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the\u000alikeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,\u000aover the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\u000aThe housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young\u000agentleman, the son of her late master\u2019s steward, who had been brought\u000aup by him at his own expense. \u201cHe is now gone into the army,\u201d she added;\u000a\u201cbut I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\u000areturn it.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd that,\u201d said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\u000a\u201cis my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\u000aother--about eight years ago.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have heard much of your master\u2019s fine person,\u201d said Mrs. Gardiner,\u000alooking at the picture; \u201cit is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\u000aus whether it is like or not.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\u000aintimation of her knowing her master.\u000a\u000a\u201cDoes that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth coloured, and said: \u201cA little.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\u2019am?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, very handsome.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you\u000awill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\u000amaster\u2019s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\u000abe then. He was very fond of them.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\u2019s being among them.\u000a\u000aMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\u000awhen she was only eight years old.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\u201d said Mrs. Gardiner.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\u000aaccomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is\u000aa new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she\u000acomes here to-morrow with him.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her\u000acommunicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either\u000aby pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\u000amaster and his sister.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his\u000atime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cExcept,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201cwhen she goes to Ramsgate.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf your master would marry, you might see more of him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\u000agood enough for him.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \u201cIt is\u000avery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,\u201d\u000a replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she\u000alistened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, \u201cI have\u000anever known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever\u000asince he was four years old.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\u000aideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\u000aHer keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was\u000agrateful to her uncle for saying:\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\u000ahaving such a master.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could\u000anot meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\u000agood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and\u000ahe was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\u000aworld.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth almost stared at her. \u201cCan this be Mr. Darcy?\u201d thought she.\u000a\u000a\u201cHis father was an excellent man,\u201d said Mrs. Gardiner.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\u000aas affable to the poor.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\u000aReynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\u000aof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\u000afurniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\u000aprejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\u000amaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\u000amany merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is the best landlord, and the best master,\u201d said she, \u201cthat ever\u000alived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but\u000athemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give\u000ahim a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw\u000aanything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away\u000alike other young men.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn what an amiable light does this place him!\u201d thought Elizabeth.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis fine account of him,\u201d whispered her aunt as they walked, \u201cis not\u000aquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps we might be deceived.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is not very likely; our authority was too good.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty\u000asitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\u000athe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\u000agive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when\u000alast at Pemberley.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is certainly a good brother,\u201d said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\u000aone of the windows.\u000a\u000aMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\u2019s delight, when she should enter\u000athe room. \u201cAnd this is always the way with him,\u201d she added. \u201cWhatever\u000acan give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There\u000ais nothing he would not do for her.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were\u000aall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;\u000abut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\u000avisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\u000aDarcy\u2019s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\u000aalso more intelligible.\u000a\u000aIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\u000alittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of\u000athe only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested\u000aher--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a\u000asmile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he\u000alooked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest\u000acontemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.\u000aMrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\u2019s\u000alifetime.\u000a\u000aThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\u2019s mind, a more gentle\u000asensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of\u000atheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\u000awas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\u000aof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\u000aconsidered how many people\u2019s happiness were in his guardianship!--how\u000amuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of\u000agood or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought\u000aforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\u000astood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his\u000aeyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\u000agratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\u000asoftened its impropriety of expression.\u000a\u000aWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\u000athey returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\u000aconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.\u000a\u000aAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\u000ato look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former\u000awas conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\u000asuddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\u000a\u000aThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his\u000aappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\u000ainstantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest\u000ablush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\u000asurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\u000aand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\u000aof perfect civility.\u000a\u000aShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\u000areceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\u000aovercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\u000athey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\u000athat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener\u2019s expression of surprise, on\u000abeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\u000aaloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\u000ascarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer\u000ashe returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\u000aalteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that\u000ahe uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\u000aimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\u000aminutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\u000aher life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent\u000ahad none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as\u000ato the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in\u000aDerbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\u000adistraction of his thoughts.\u000a\u000aAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\u000amoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\u000aleave.\u000a\u000aThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but\u000aElizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,\u000afollowed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her\u000acoming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the\u000aworld! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light\u000amight it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely\u000athrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he\u000athus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\u000asooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;\u000afor it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted\u000afrom his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over\u000athe perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly\u000aaltered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was\u000aamazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!\u000aNever in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never\u000ahad he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What\u000aa contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put\u000ahis letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account\u000afor it.\u000a\u000aThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\u000aevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\u000areach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time\u000abefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\u000amechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and\u000aseemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\u000adistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\u000aone spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\u000awas. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in\u000awhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\u000ashe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\u000afelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\u000anot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\u000aseeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\u000acomposure.\u000a\u000aAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\u000aaroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\u000a\u000aThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\u000aascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of\u000athe trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the\u000avalley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading\u000amany, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\u000aof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.\u000aWith a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.\u000aIt settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which\u000abrought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,\u000ato the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed\u000ait by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;\u000ait was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\u000avalley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\u000aand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\u000aElizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the\u000abridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\u000awho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only\u000aof returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\u000atherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\u000aon the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\u000aprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\u000ataste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\u000aoccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the\u000aman about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\u000aslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth\u2019s astonishment\u000awas quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\u000aapproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here\u000aless sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\u000athey met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared\u000afor an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\u000acalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\u000ashe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\u000alasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\u000aturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw\u000athat he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\u000apoliteness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\u000abut she had not got beyond the words \u201cdelightful,\u201d and \u201ccharming,\u201d when\u000asome unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\u000aPemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,\u000aand she said no more.\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\u000aher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\u000aThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;\u000aand she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\u000aacquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had\u000arevolted in his offer to herself. \u201cWhat will be his surprise,\u201d thought\u000ashe, \u201cwhen he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of\u000afashion.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\u000arelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\u000ait, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\u000acould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\u000aconnection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and\u000aso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\u000aconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\u000acould not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had\u000asome relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\u000aattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\u000aexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\u000ahis taste, or his good manners.\u000a\u000aThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\u000ainvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\u000achose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time\u000ato supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\u000athe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\u000awalking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.\u000aElizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\u000amust be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\u000acontinually was she repeating, \u201cWhy is he so altered? From what can\u000ait proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his\u000amanners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a\u000achange as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\u000agentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to\u000athe brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\u000awater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated\u000ain Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\u000aElizabeth\u2019s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\u000aher husband\u2019s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\u000atogether. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him\u000ato know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\u000aplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\u000avery unexpected--\u201cfor your housekeeper,\u201d she added, \u201cinformed us that\u000ayou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we\u000aleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected\u000ain the country.\u201d He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\u000abusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\u000abefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \u201cThey\u000awill join me early to-morrow,\u201d he continued, \u201cand among them are some\u000awho will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\u000adriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley\u2019s name had been the last\u000amentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_\u000amind was not very differently engaged.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is also one other person in the party,\u201d he continued after a\u000apause, \u201cwho more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\u000ame, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\u000aduring your stay at Lambton?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\u000afor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\u000athat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her\u000amust be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was\u000asatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\u000ahim think really ill of her.\u000a\u000aThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\u000awas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\u000apleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\u000athe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had\u000areached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\u000amile behind.\u000a\u000aHe then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\u000atired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\u000ahave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\u000athere seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected\u000athat she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale\u000awith great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her\u000apatience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was\u000aover. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s coming up they were all pressed to go\u000ainto the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and\u000athey parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\u000aladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\u000awalking slowly towards the house.\u000a\u000aThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\u000apronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\u000a\u201cHe is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\u201d said her uncle.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,\u201d replied her\u000aaunt, \u201cbut it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\u000asay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I\u000ahave seen nothing of it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\u000athan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\u000aattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo be sure, Lizzy,\u201d said her aunt, \u201che is not so handsome as Wickham;\u000aor, rather, he has not Wickham\u2019s countenance, for his features\u000aare perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so\u000adisagreeable?\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked\u000ahim better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never\u000aseen him so pleasant as this morning.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\u201d replied\u000aher uncle. \u201cYour great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\u000aat his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off\u000ahis grounds.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but\u000asaid nothing.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom what we have seen of him,\u201d continued Mrs. Gardiner, \u201cI really\u000ashould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\u000aanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\u000aOn the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\u000aspeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would\u000anot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\u000agood lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\u000aI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\u000amaster, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every\u000avirtue.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\u000ahis behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in\u000aas guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from\u000ahis relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\u000aconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\u000aWickham\u2019s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\u000aconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\u000atransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\u000aher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\u000aapproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\u000athe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\u000ato her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of\u000aanything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning\u2019s walk they\u000ahad no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\u000aacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a\u000aintercourse renewed after many years\u2019 discontinuance.\u000a\u000aThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\u000amuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\u000abut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy\u2019s civility, and, above\u000aall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 44\u000a\u000a\u000aElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\u000aher the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\u000aresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\u000aBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their\u000aarrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\u000aplace with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn\u000ato dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\u000acarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in\u000aa curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing\u000athe livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\u000asurprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she\u000aexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\u000aof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\u000aof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\u000athe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that\u000athere was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a\u000aquarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\u000anewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\u000aElizabeth\u2019s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite\u000aamazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,\u000ashe dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much\u000ain her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\u000asuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\u000a\u000aShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\u000aup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\u000ainquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\u000a\u000aMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\u000atook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\u000aacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\u000abeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\u000abut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\u000aonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\u000aher beyond a monosyllable.\u000a\u000aMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\u000alittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\u000awomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there\u000awas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\u000aunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\u000aacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\u000arelieved by discerning such different feelings.\u000a\u000aThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley\u000awas also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\u000asatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley\u2019s quick\u000astep was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\u000aElizabeth\u2019s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\u000afelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\u000acordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\u000ainquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked\u000aand spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\u000a\u000aTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\u000athan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\u000athem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\u000aarisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards\u000aeach with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\u000athose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew\u000awhat it was to love. Of the lady\u2019s sensations they remained a little\u000ain doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\u000aevident enough.\u000a\u000aElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\u000afeelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and\u000ato make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\u000afeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\u000aendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\u000awas ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\u000a\u000aIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!\u000ahow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in\u000aa like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\u000aformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\u000athat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\u000athough this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\u000abehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look\u000aappeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred\u000abetween them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point\u000ashe was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred\u000aere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\u000arecollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying\u000amore that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed\u000ato her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone\u000awhich had something of real regret, that it \u201cwas a very long time since\u000ahe had had the pleasure of seeing her;\u201d and, before she could reply,\u000ahe added, \u201cIt is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of\u000aNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\u000atook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\u000a_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\u000anor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\u000agave them meaning.\u000a\u000aIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;\u000abut, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\u000acomplaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed\u000afrom _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\u000athe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\u000atemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\u000ashe saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion\u000aof people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\u000adisgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\u000avery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\u000alively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was\u000aso great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\u000arestrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\u000aof his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\u000aat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\u000aself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance\u000acould result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\u000aacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw\u000adown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\u000aRosings.\u000a\u000aTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose\u000ato depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\u000atheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\u000aat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\u000adiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\u000areadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\u000ahow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\u000aacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,\u000athat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\u000aany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\u000asociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\u000aher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\u000a\u000aBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\u000aagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\u000amake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\u000athis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on\u000athis account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\u000avisitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some\u000asatisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\u000alittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\u000auncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\u000afavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\u000a\u000aBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s curiosity; it was\u000anot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\u000amuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\u000ait was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\u000ainterest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\u000a\u000aOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\u000aas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\u000anot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\u000afrom their own feelings and his servant\u2019s report, without any reference\u000ato any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\u000awould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\u000ahowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\u000athat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\u000ayears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\u000ahastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\u000atheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\u000anothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\u000ait would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town\u000awhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\u000awas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\u000a\u000aWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\u000athere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\u000ason of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\u000afact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\u000ahim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\u000a\u000aAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\u000athe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\u000along enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;\u000aand she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She\u000acertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\u000ahad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\u000athat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\u000avaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\u000atime ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened\u000ainto somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\u000ahis favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\u000awhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\u000athere was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\u000aIt was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,\u000abut for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and\u000aacrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\u000aaccompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid\u000aher as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most\u000aeager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display\u000aof regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only\u000awere concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent\u000aon making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much\u000apride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent\u000alove, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a\u000asort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\u000aexactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\u000ashe felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\u000afar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would\u000abe for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her\u000afancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of\u000ahis addresses.\u000a\u000aIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that\u000asuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy\u2019s in coming to see them on the\u000avery day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a\u000alate breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,\u000aby some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that\u000ait would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\u000amorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\u000ashe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\u000a\u000aMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\u000arenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\u000asome of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 45\u000a\u000a\u000aConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley\u2019s dislike of her had\u000aoriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her\u000aappearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how\u000amuch civility on that lady\u2019s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.\u000a\u000aOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\u000awhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows\u000aopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\u000ahills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\u000awhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\u000a\u000aIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\u000awith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\u000aLondon. Georgiana\u2019s reception of them was very civil, but attended with\u000aall the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear\u000aof doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior\u000athe belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\u000ahowever, did her justice, and pitied her.\u000a\u000aBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,\u000aon their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\u000asucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\u000agenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\u000aof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\u000aothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\u000aElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\u000awished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\u000ashort sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\u000a\u000aElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\u000aand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\u000acalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\u000afrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\u000ainconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\u000aof saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\u000amoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\u000afeared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\u000ashe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\u000asitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss\u000aBingley\u2019s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\u000ainquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\u000aindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\u000a\u000aThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\u000aentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\u000afinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many\u000aa significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\u000agiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\u000aparty--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\u000abeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\u000athem round the table.\u000a\u000aWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\u000ashe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\u000afeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\u000aa moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\u000aregret that he came.\u000a\u000aHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\u000agentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\u000aonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\u000aGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely\u000aresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more\u000anecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\u000asaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\u000aand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\u000awhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\u000acuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\u2019s, in spite of the\u000asmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\u000aobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\u000ato Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother\u2019s\u000aentrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\u000awas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded\u000aas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\u000aBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\u000afirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\u000a\u000a\u201cPray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?\u000aThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Darcy\u2019s presence she dared not mention Wickham\u2019s name; but Elizabeth\u000ainstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\u000avarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment\u2019s distress;\u000abut exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\u000apresently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While\u000ashe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened\u000acomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\u000aconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\u000apain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would\u000ahave refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\u000aElizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\u000aher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\u000aDarcy\u2019s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\u000aand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected\u000awith that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\u2019s\u000ameditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\u000awas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\u2019s connections\u000aher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very\u000awish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\u000ahereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\u000ameaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\u000aBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\u000afor the welfare of his friend.\u000a\u000aElizabeth\u2019s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\u000aas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\u000aWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\u000ato speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\u000arecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\u000ahad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\u000afixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\u000a\u000aTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\u000amentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss\u000aBingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\u2019s person,\u000abehaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\u2019s\u000arecommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not\u000aerr. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana\u000awithout the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When\u000aDarcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to\u000ahim some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\u201d she\u000acried; \u201cI never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since\u000athe winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing\u000athat we should not have known her again.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\u000ahimself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than\u000aher being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\u000asummer.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor my own part,\u201d she rejoined, \u201cI must confess that I never could\u000asee any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\u000abrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose\u000awants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\u000atolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,\u000awhich have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything\u000aextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do\u000anot like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency\u000awithout fashion, which is intolerable.\u201d\u000a\u000aPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\u000athe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\u000awise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\u000asuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a\u000adetermination of making him speak, she continued:\u000a\u000a\u201cI remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\u000awere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\u000ayour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, \u2018_She_\u000aa beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.\u2019 But afterwards she\u000aseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\u000aone time.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \u201cbut _that_\u000awas only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have\u000aconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\u000ahaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\u000avisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\u000aboth. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\u000aexcept of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\u000aof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but\u000ahimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\u000ahim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece\u2019s\u000abeginning the subject.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 46\u000a\u000a\u000aElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\u000aJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been\u000arenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but\u000aon the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the\u000areceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\u000ait had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\u000aJane had written the direction remarkably ill.\u000a\u000aThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and\u000aher uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\u000athemselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been\u000awritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\u000alittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\u000abut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\u000aagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:\u000a\u000a\u201cSince writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\u000amost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\u000aassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\u000aAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\u000afrom Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\u000awith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\u000asurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\u000avery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\u000ato hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\u000aThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step\u000a(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\u000adisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\u000aOur poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\u000athankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against\u000ahim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\u000atwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\u000aeight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\u000apassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\u000ahim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\u000atheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\u000amother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\u000aknow what I have written.\u201d\u000a\u000aWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\u000awhat she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the\u000aother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\u000ahad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\u000a\u000a\u201cBy this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I\u000awish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my\u000ahead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest\u000aLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\u000aand it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham\u000aand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\u000ataken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\u000ato Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\u000aday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia\u2019s short\u000aletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\u000aGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\u000anever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was\u000arepeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.\u000aintending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,\u000abut no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney\u000acoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that\u000ais known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.\u000aI know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that\u000aside London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing\u000athem at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but\u000awithout any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With\u000athe kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions\u000ato us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved\u000afor him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our\u000adistress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the\u000aworst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make\u000ait more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue\u000atheir first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a\u000ayoung woman of Lydia\u2019s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose\u000aher so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that\u000aColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his\u000ahead when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to\u000abe trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she\u000aexert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And\u000aas to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has\u000aanger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of\u000aconfidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you\u000ahave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the\u000afirst shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not\u000aso selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I\u000atake up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but\u000acircumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to\u000acome here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,\u000athat I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something\u000amore to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel\u000aForster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure\u000aI know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any\u000ameasure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to\u000abe at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my\u000auncle\u2019s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will\u000aimmediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! where, where is my uncle?\u201d cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\u000aas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing\u000aa moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was\u000aopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous\u000amanner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,\u000ashe, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia\u2019s situation,\u000ahastily exclaimed, \u201cI beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find\u000aMr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not\u000aan instant to lose.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood God! what is the matter?\u201d cried he, with more feeling than\u000apoliteness; then recollecting himself, \u201cI will not detain you a minute;\u000abut let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\u000anot well enough; you cannot go yourself.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how\u000alittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\u000athe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless\u000aan accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\u000amistress home instantly.\u000a\u000aOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and\u000alooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\u000aor to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\u000a\u201cLet me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\u000apresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I thank you,\u201d she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \u201cThere\u000ais nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by\u000asome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\u000anot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\u000asomething indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate\u000asilence. At length she spoke again. \u201cI have just had a letter from Jane,\u000awith such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger\u000asister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into\u000athe power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.\u000a_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no\u000aconnections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.\u201d\u000a\u000aDarcy was fixed in astonishment. \u201cWhen I consider,\u201d she added in a yet\u000amore agitated voice, \u201cthat I might have prevented it! I, who knew what\u000ahe was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I\u000alearnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not\u000ahave happened. But it is all--all too late now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am grieved indeed,\u201d cried Darcy; \u201cgrieved--shocked. But is it\u000acertain--absolutely certain?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\u000aalmost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to\u000aScotland.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle\u2019s\u000aimmediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But\u000anothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\u000asuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\u000anot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\u201d\u000a\u000aDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what\u000aI ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\u000amuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!\u201d\u000a\u000aDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking\u000aup and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air\u000agloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her\u000apower was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\u000aweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\u000awonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\u000aconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\u000awas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\u000awishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\u000ahim, as now, when all love must be vain.\u000a\u000aBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\u000ahumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed\u000aup every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\u000aElizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\u000aseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by\u000athe voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\u000acompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \u201cI am afraid you have been\u000along desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my\u000astay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything\u000acould be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\u000asuch distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may\u000aseem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I\u000afear, prevent my sister\u2019s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley\u000ato-day.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\u000aurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\u000along as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for\u000aher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\u000areason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\u000aone serious, parting look, went away.\u000a\u000aAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\u000ashould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as\u000ahad marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\u000aretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full\u000aof contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\u000afeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\u000aformerly have rejoiced in its termination.\u000a\u000aIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth\u2019s\u000achange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\u000aotherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\u000aunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on\u000aa first interview with its object, and even before two words have been\u000aexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\u000asomewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,\u000aand that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other\u000aless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him\u000ago with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\u2019s infamy must\u000aproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\u000abusiness. Never, since reading Jane\u2019s second letter, had she entertained\u000aa hope of Wickham\u2019s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\u000acould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\u000aof her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\u000aletter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\u000aWickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\u000afor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\u000aincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\u000aas this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose\u000aLydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention\u000aof marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue\u000anor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\u000a\u000aShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\u000aLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia\u000awanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\u000aofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\u000araised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been\u000afluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\u000amistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\u000afeel it!\u000a\u000aShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\u000ashare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\u000afamily so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\u000arequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\u000acould be done for Lydia, her uncle\u2019s interference seemed of the utmost\u000aimportance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.\u000aand Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant\u2019s\u000aaccount that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them\u000ainstantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their\u000asummons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript\u000aof the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a\u000afavourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply\u000aafflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the\u000afirst exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every\u000aassistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked\u000ahim with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,\u000aeverything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to\u000abe off as soon as possible. \u201cBut what is to be done about Pemberley?\u201d\u000a cried Mrs. Gardiner. \u201cJohn told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\u000aus; was it so?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\u000a_That_ is all settled.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is all settled?\u201d repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\u000aprepare. \u201cAnd are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\u000atruth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\u201d\u000a\u000aBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the\u000ahurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\u000ato be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\u000aimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\u000abusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\u000abe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\u000asudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\u000aGardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\u000aremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\u000athe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\u000ahave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 47\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cI have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\u201d said her uncle, as they\u000adrove from the town; \u201cand really, upon serious consideration, I am much\u000amore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the\u000amatter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should\u000aform such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\u000afriendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel\u2019s family, that I\u000aam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\u000awould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\u000aregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\u000anot adequate to the risk!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\u000a\u000a\u201cUpon my word,\u201d said Mrs. Gardiner, \u201cI begin to be of your uncle\u2019s\u000aopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\u000ainterest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of\u000aWickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe\u000ahim capable of it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\u000aneglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I\u000adare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been\u000athe case?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the first place,\u201d replied Mr. Gardiner, \u201cthere is no absolute proof\u000athat they are not gone to Scotland.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such\u000aa presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\u000aBarnet road.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though\u000afor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is\u000anot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\u000amight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\u000aexpeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\u000amarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\u000afriend, you see by Jane\u2019s account, was persuaded of his never intending\u000ato marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\u000acannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she\u000abeyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,\u000aforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\u000arestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\u000adishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\u000anothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\u000aother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has\u000ano brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\u2019s\u000abehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\u000aseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\u000ado as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\u000asuch a matter.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him\u000aas to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\u201d replied Elizabeth, with\u000atears in her eyes, \u201cthat a sister\u2019s sense of decency and virtue in such\u000aa point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\u000aPerhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never\u000abeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,\u000anay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement\u000aand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\u000aand frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\u000aSince the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\u000aflirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing\u000aeverything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\u000agreater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are\u000anaturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\u000aperson and address that can captivate a woman.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut you see that Jane,\u201d said her aunt, \u201cdoes not think so very ill of\u000aWickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOf whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\u000atheir former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,\u000atill it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\u000aWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\u000asense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\u000aas false and deceitful as he is insinuating.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd do you really know all this?\u201d cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\u000aas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do indeed,\u201d replied Elizabeth, colouring. \u201cI told you, the other day,\u000aof his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at\u000aLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved\u000awith such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\u000acircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\u000arelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\u000awhat he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\u000areserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\u000amust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\u000aher.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\u000aand Jane seem so well to understand?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\u000aso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\u000aignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire\u000awas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight\u2019s time. As that was the\u000acase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\u000anecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could\u000ait apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the\u000aneighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was\u000asettled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\u000aher eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be\u000ain any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\u000aconsequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far\u000aenough from my thoughts.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\u000asuppose, to believe them fond of each other?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\u000aside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\u000athat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\u000ahe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\u000awere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\u000athe first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\u000aattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\u000awild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\u000awho treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\u201d\u000a\u000a                          * * * * *\u000a\u000aIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\u000ato their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by\u000aits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\u000athe whole of the journey. From Elizabeth\u2019s thoughts it was never absent.\u000aFixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find\u000ano interval of ease or forgetfulness.\u000a\u000aThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night\u000aon the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a\u000acomfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied\u000aby long expectations.\u000a\u000aThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\u000aon the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the\u000acarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\u000afaces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\u000acapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\u000a\u000aElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\u000ahurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her\u000amother\u2019s apartment, immediately met her.\u000a\u000aElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\u000aeyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\u000aheard of the fugitives.\u000a\u000a\u201cNot yet,\u201d replied Jane. \u201cBut now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\u000aeverything will be well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs my father in town?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd have you heard from him often?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say\u000athat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\u000aparticularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write\u000aagain till he had something of importance to mention.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd my mother--how is she? How are you all?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\u000ashaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\u000aall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\u000aHeaven, are quite well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut you--how are you?\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cYou look pale. How much you\u000amust have gone through!\u201d\u000a\u000aHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\u000aconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\u000aengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach\u000aof the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\u000athanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\u000a\u000aWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\u000ahad already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\u000afound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of\u000agood, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet\u000adeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\u000aevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\u000ato explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes\u2019\u000aconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\u000atears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\u000aconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\u000ablaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\u000aerrors of her daughter must principally be owing.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I had been able,\u201d said she, \u201cto carry my point in going to Brighton,\u000awith all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia\u000ahad nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\u000aof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\u000aside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been\u000awell looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the\u000acharge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!\u000aAnd now here\u2019s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,\u000awherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become\u000aof us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his\u000agrave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we\u000ashall do.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\u000ageneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\u000athat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\u000aBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\u000a\u000a\u201cDo not give way to useless alarm,\u201d added he; \u201cthough it is right to be\u000aprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\u000aIt is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we\u000amay gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\u000aand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\u000alost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make\u000ahim come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult\u000atogether as to what is to be done.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! my dear brother,\u201d replied Mrs. Bennet, \u201cthat is exactly what I\u000acould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\u000awherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\u000amarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\u000atell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\u000aafter they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\u000aTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my\u000awits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such\u000aspasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that\u000aI can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to\u000agive any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does\u000anot know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I\u000aknow you will contrive it all.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\u000ain the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well\u000ain her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till\u000adinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on\u000athe housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\u000a\u000aThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\u000aoccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\u000aoppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\u000atongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\u000abetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\u000amost trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\u000asubject.\u000a\u000aIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\u000atoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\u000abefore. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The\u000afaces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible\u000ain either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\u000awhich she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of\u000afretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\u000amistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance\u000aof grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\u000aBut we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\u000aeach other the balm of sisterly consolation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\u000a\u201cUnhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\u000alesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one\u000afalse step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less\u000abrittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in\u000aher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed\u000ato make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\u000akind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\u000a\u000aIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\u000ahalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of\u000athe opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to\u000asatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\u000aof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\u000aBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\u000athe subject, by saying, \u201cBut tell me all and everything about it which\u000aI have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\u000aForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\u000atook place? They must have seen them together for ever.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cColonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\u000aespecially on Lydia\u2019s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\u000agrieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\u000a_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\u000aany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\u000afirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\u000atheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\u000atheir plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\u000arepeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am\u000ainclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\u000adoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt\u000aa little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister\u2019s happiness with him\u000ain marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\u000aright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\u000aimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\u000atriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia\u2019s last letter\u000ashe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\u000abeing in love with each other, many weeks.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut not before they went to Brighton?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I believe not.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does\u000ahe know his real character?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\u000adid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad\u000aaffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;\u000abut I hope this may be false.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\u000athis could not have happened!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps it would have been better,\u201d replied her sister. \u201cBut to expose\u000athe former faults of any person without knowing what their present\u000afeelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCould Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\u2019s note to his\u000awife?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe brought it with him for us to see.\u201d\u000a\u000aJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These\u000awere the contents:\u000a\u000a\u201cMY DEAR HARRIET,\u000a\u000a\u201cYou will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\u000alaughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am\u000amissed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,\u000aI shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I\u000alove, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think\u000ait no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my\u000agoing, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,\u000awhen I write to them and sign my name \u2018Lydia Wickham.\u2019 What a good joke\u000ait will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to\u000aPratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.\u000aTell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will\u000adance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall\u000asend for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell\u000aSally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are\u000apacked up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will\u000adrink to our good journey.\u000a\u000a\u201cYour affectionate friend,\u000a\u000a\u201cLYDIA BENNET.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\u201d cried Elizabeth when she had\u000afinished it. \u201cWhat a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!\u000aBut at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their\u000ajourney. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her\u000aside a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten\u000aminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in\u000asuch confusion!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! Jane,\u201d cried Elizabeth, \u201cwas there a servant belonging to it who\u000adid not know the whole story before the end of the day?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is\u000avery difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to\u000agive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so\u000amuch as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen\u000aalmost took from me my faculties.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look\u000awell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety\u000aupon yourself alone.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every\u000afatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.\u000aKitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours\u000aof repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn\u000aon Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\u000aThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And\u000aLady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\u000acondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters\u2019, if\u000athey should be of use to us.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe had better have stayed at home,\u201d cried Elizabeth; \u201cperhaps she\u000a_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see\u000atoo little of one\u2019s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence\u000ainsufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had\u000aintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe meant I believe,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cto go to Epsom, the place where\u000athey last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could\u000abe made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the\u000anumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come\u000awith a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a\u000agentleman and lady\u2019s removing from one carriage into another might\u000abe remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow\u000adiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\u000adetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible\u000ato find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any\u000aother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,\u000aand his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\u000aout even so much as this.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 48\u000a\u000a\u000aThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next\u000amorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.\u000aHis family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and\u000adilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.\u000aThey were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to\u000asend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.\u000aGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\u000a\u000aWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant\u000ainformation of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,\u000ato prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,\u000ato the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only\u000asecurity for her husband\u2019s not being killed in a duel.\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few\u000adays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable\u000ato her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a\u000agreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also\u000avisited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of\u000acheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without\u000areporting some fresh instance of Wickham\u2019s extravagance or irregularity,\u000ashe seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\u000athem.\u000a\u000aAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months\u000abefore, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt\u000ato every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with\u000athe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman\u2019s family.\u000aEverybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;\u000aand everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the\u000aappearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\u000ahalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of\u000aher sister\u2019s ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less\u000aof it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come\u000awhen, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely\u000adespaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of\u000athem.\u000a\u000aMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a\u000aletter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately\u000afound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;\u000athat Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,\u000abut without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now\u000adetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\u000athought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first\u000acoming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself\u000adid not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was\u000aeager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.\u000aBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised\u000ato write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:\u000a\u000a\u201cI have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\u000apossible, from some of the young man\u2019s intimates in the regiment,\u000awhether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to\u000aknow in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were\u000aanyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a\u000aclue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have\u000anothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in\u000ahis power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,\u000aLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any\u000aother person.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her\u000aauthority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information\u000aof so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never\u000aheard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both\u000aof whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of\u000ahis companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;\u000aand though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application\u000awas a something to look forward to.\u000a\u000aEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\u000apart of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters\u000awas the grand object of every morning\u2019s impatience. Through letters,\u000awhatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every\u000asucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\u000a\u000aBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for\u000atheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane\u000ahad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\u000ashe accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\u000aletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as\u000afollows:\u000a\u000a\u201cMY DEAR SIR,\u000a\u000a\u201cI feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\u000ain life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\u000asuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from\u000aHertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself\u000asincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in\u000ayour present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because\u000aproceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be\u000awanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that\u000amay comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the\u000amost afflicting to a parent\u2019s mind. The death of your daughter would\u000ahave been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to\u000abe lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte\u000ainforms me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has\u000aproceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,\u000afor the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think\u000athat her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be\u000aguilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,\u000ayou are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined\u000aby Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to\u000awhom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that\u000athis false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of\u000aall the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,\u000awill connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads\u000ame moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event\u000aof last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\u000ain all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to\u000aconsole yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child\u000afrom your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her\u000aown heinous offense.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am, dear sir, etc., etc.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from\u000aColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\u000aIt was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he\u000akept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one\u000aliving. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he\u000ahad been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of\u000aparticular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,\u000awho could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the\u000awretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for\u000asecrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia\u2019s relations, for\u000ait had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a\u000avery considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a\u000athousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.\u000aHe owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\u000aformidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars\u000afrom the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d\u000a she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their\u000afather at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered\u000aspiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded\u000ato his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and\u000aleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\u000afor continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did\u000anot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\u000awhat her anxiety for his life had been before.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he\u000awill not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,\u000aand make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she\u000aand the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet\u000acame from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their\u000ajourney, and brought its master back to Longbourn.\u000a\u000aMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her\u000aDerbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His\u000aname had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and\u000athe kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their\u000abeing followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had\u000areceived none since her return that could come from Pemberley.\u000a\u000aThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for\u000athe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be\u000afairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time\u000atolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware\u000athat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\u000aLydia\u2019s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,\u000aone sleepless night out of two.\u000a\u000aWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\u000aphilosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the\u000ahabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\u000aaway, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of\u000ait.\u000a\u000aIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that\u000aElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly\u000aexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, \u201cSay\u000anothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,\u000aand I ought to feel it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must not be too severe upon yourself,\u201d replied Elizabeth.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone\u000ato fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have\u000abeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\u000aIt will pass away soon enough.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you suppose them to be in London?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; where else can they be so well concealed?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd Lydia used to want to go to London,\u201d added Kitty.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is happy then,\u201d said her father drily; \u201cand her residence there\u000awill probably be of some duration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThen after a short silence he continued:\u000a\u000a\u201cLizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me\u000alast May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother\u2019s\u000atea.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a parade,\u201d he cried, \u201cwhich does one good; it gives such an\u000aelegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my\u000alibrary, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as\u000aI can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not going to run away, papa,\u201d said Kitty fretfully. \u201cIf I should\u000aever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne\u000afor fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and\u000ayou will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into\u000amy house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be\u000aabsolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.\u000aAnd you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have\u000aspent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.\u201d\u000a\u000aKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, well,\u201d said he, \u201cdo not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good\u000agirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of\u000athem.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 49\u000a\u000a\u000aTwo days after Mr. Bennet\u2019s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking\u000atogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper\u000acoming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their\u000amother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,\u000awhen they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \u201cI beg your pardon,\u000amadam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some\u000agood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDear madam,\u201d cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, \u201cdon\u2019t you know\u000athere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here\u000athis half-hour, and master has had a letter.\u201d\u000a\u000aAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They\u000aran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the\u000alibrary; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of\u000aseeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the\u000abutler, who said:\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you are looking for my master, ma\u2019am, he is walking towards the\u000alittle copse.\u201d\u000a\u000aUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once\u000amore, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately\u000apursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\u000a\u000aJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as\u000aElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,\u000acame up with him, and eagerly cried out:\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes I have had a letter from him by express.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, and what news does it bring--good or bad?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is there of good to be expected?\u201d said he, taking the letter from\u000ahis pocket. \u201cBut perhaps you would like to read it.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\u000a\u000a\u201cRead it aloud,\u201d said their father, \u201cfor I hardly know myself what it is\u000aabout.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.\u000a\u000a\u201cMY DEAR BROTHER,\u000a\u000a\u201cAt last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,\u000aupon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you\u000aleft me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of\u000aLondon they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough\u000ato know they are discovered. I have seen them both--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen it is as I always hoped,\u201d cried Jane; \u201cthey are married!\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth read on:\u000a\u000a\u201cI have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there\u000awas any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the\u000aengagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will\u000anot be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure\u000ato your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand\u000apounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and\u000amy sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,\u000aduring your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\u000awhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,\u000aas far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by\u000aexpress, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You\u000awill easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham\u2019s\u000acircumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.\u000aThe world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there\u000awill be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to\u000asettle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude\u000awill be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout\u000athe whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to\u000aHaggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the\u000asmallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at\u000aLongbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as\u000afast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it\u000abest that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope\u000ayou will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as\u000aanything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,\u000a\u000a\u201cEDW. GARDINER.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it possible?\u201d cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \u201cCan it be\u000apossible that he will marry her?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\u201d said her\u000asister. \u201cMy dear father, I congratulate you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd have you answered the letter?\u201d cried Elizabeth.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo; but it must be done soon.\u201d\u000a\u000aMost earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he\u000awrote.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! my dear father,\u201d she cried, \u201ccome back and write immediately.\u000aConsider how important every moment is in such a case.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet me write for you,\u201d said Jane, \u201cif you dislike the trouble\u000ayourself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI dislike it very much,\u201d he replied; \u201cbut it must be done.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd may I ask--\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut the terms, I suppose, must be\u000acomplied with.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cComplied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there\u000aare two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money\u000ayour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever\u000ato pay him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMoney! My uncle!\u201d cried Jane, \u201cwhat do you mean, sir?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a\u000atemptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am\u000agone.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is very true,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cthough it had not occurred to me\u000abefore. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!\u000ait must be my uncle\u2019s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has\u000adistressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d said her father; \u201cWickham\u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing\u000aless than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,\u000ain the very beginning of our relationship.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\u000arepaid?\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued\u000asilent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the\u000alibrary to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd they are really to be married!\u201d cried Elizabeth, as soon as they\u000awere by themselves. \u201cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be\u000athankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,\u000aand wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI comfort myself with thinking,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cthat he certainly would\u000anot marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind\u000auncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\u000athousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children\u000aof his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand\u000apounds?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf he were ever able to learn what Wickham\u2019s debts have been,\u201d said\u000aElizabeth, \u201cand how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\u000aexactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\u000anot sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never\u000abe requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\u000aprotection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\u000ayears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\u000aactually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\u000ashe will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\u000afirst sees my aunt!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\u201d said\u000aJane: \u201cI hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to\u000amarry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\u000athinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\u000athey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\u000atime make their past imprudence forgotten.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTheir conduct has been such,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cas neither you, nor\u000aI, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\u000aperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\u000atherefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make\u000ait known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly\u000areplied:\u000a\u000a\u201cJust as you please.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMay we take my uncle\u2019s letter to read to her?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTake whatever you like, and get away.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs\u000atogether. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication\u000awould, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,\u000athe letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As\u000asoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner\u2019s hope of Lydia\u2019s being soon\u000amarried, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\u000aexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she\u000ahad ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\u000awould be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\u000afelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear, dear Lydia!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is delightful indeed! She will\u000abe married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!\u000aMy good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage\u000aeverything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\u000aclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\u000athem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him\u000ahow much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\u000aKitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\u000aLydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!\u201d\u000a\u000aHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\u000athese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\u000aGardiner\u2019s behaviour laid them all under.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor we must attribute this happy conclusion,\u201d she added, \u201cin a great\u000ameasure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to\u000aassist Mr. Wickham with money.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cit is all very right; who should do it but\u000aher own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\u000amust have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have\u000aever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!\u000aIn a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\u000ait sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\u000asuch a flutter, that I am sure I can\u2019t write; so I will dictate, and\u000ayou write for me. We will settle with your father about the money\u000aafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\u000acambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\u000anot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her\u000afather was at leisure to be consulted. One day\u2019s delay, she observed,\u000awould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\u000aso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.\u000a\u000a\u201cI will go to Meryton,\u201d said she, \u201cas soon as I am dressed, and tell the\u000agood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call\u000aon Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.\u000aAn airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do\u000aanything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you\u000aheard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\u000aall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\u000acongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\u000arefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\u000a\u000aPoor Lydia\u2019s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was\u000ano worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in\u000alooking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could\u000abe justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had\u000afeared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had\u000agained.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 50\u000a\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,\u000ainstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for\u000athe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\u000ahim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\u000arespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever\u000aof honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\u000aprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be\u000aher husband might then have rested in its proper place.\u000a\u000aHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\u000ashould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he\u000awas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\u000aand to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\u000a\u000aWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\u000auseless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join\u000ain cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\u000aand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\u000asuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\u000aBennet, for many years after Lydia\u2019s birth, had been certain that he\u000awould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then\u000atoo late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\u000ahusband\u2019s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\u000aincome.\u000a\u000aFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\u000athe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\u000alatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\u000aregard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\u000acould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\u000aterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,\u000athough expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\u000aapprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\u000aengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\u000athat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would\u000abe done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\u000aarrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the\u000ahundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\u000aallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\u000athrough her mother\u2019s hands, Lydia\u2019s expenses had been very little within\u000athat sum.\u000a\u000aThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\u000aanother very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as\u000alittle trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\u000aof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\u000anaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\u000adispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick\u000ain its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he\u000awas indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any\u000amessage to her.\u000a\u000aThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate\u000aspeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\u000aphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage\u000aof conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\u000ahappiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant\u000afarmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\u000agood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from\u000aall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit\u000ain this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery\u000awas considered certain.\u000a\u000aIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this\u000ahappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\u000aspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\u000atriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object\u000aof her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\u000aaccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\u000aattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\u000aservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\u000aproper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering\u000awhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\u000aimportance.\u000a\u000a\u201cHaye Park might do,\u201d said she, \u201cif the Gouldings could quit it--or the\u000agreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\u000atoo far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\u000aPulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\u000aservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: \u201cMrs.\u000aBennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and\u000adaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\u000aneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\u000aimpudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\u201d\u000a\u000aA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It\u000asoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\u000athat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\u000adaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\u000aaffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\u000ait. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\u000aresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her\u000amarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe\u000apossible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new\u000aclothes must reflect on her daughter\u2019s nuptials, than to any sense of\u000ashame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\u000atook place.\u000a\u000aElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\u000athe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\u000aher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the\u000aproper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\u000aunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\u000aspot.\u000a\u000aShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were\u000afew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\u000abut, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister\u2019s\u000afrailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear\u000aof disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,\u000athere seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia\u2019s marriage been\u000aconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\u000aMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other\u000aobjection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the\u000anearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.\u000a\u000aFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The\u000awish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\u000afeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\u000ablow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\u000ahardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\u000alonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\u000aseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\u000ashe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\u000ashould meet.\u000a\u000aWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\u000aproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now\u000ahave been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\u000adoubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,\u000athere must be a triumph.\u000a\u000aShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\u000adisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\u000atemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\u000awas an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease\u000aand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\u000aand from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she\u000amust have received benefit of greater importance.\u000a\u000aBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\u000aconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\u000aprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\u000afamily.\u000a\u000aHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,\u000ashe could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could\u000abelong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions\u000awere stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\u000a\u000a                          * * * * *\u000a\u000aMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet\u2019s\u000aacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to\u000apromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\u000athat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\u000apurport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved\u000aon quitting the militia.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was greatly my wish that he should do so,\u201d he added, \u201cas soon as\u000ahis marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in\u000aconsidering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on\u000ahis account and my niece\u2019s. It is Mr. Wickham\u2019s intention to go into\u000athe regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who\u000aare able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an\u000aensigncy in General ----\u2018s regiment, now quartered in the North. It\u000ais an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\u000apromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\u000ahave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have\u000awritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\u000aand to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\u000ain and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I\u000ahave pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\u000asimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\u000aa list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\u000ahope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,\u000aand all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\u000aunless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\u000aGardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\u000aleaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\u000ayou and her mother.--Yours, etc.,\u000a\u000a\u201cE. GARDINER.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham\u2019s removal\u000afrom the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet\u000awas not so well pleased with it. Lydia\u2019s being settled in the North,\u000ajust when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,\u000afor she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\u000aHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a\u000apity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\u000awith everybody, and had so many favourites.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\u201d said she, \u201cit will be quite shocking\u000ato send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she\u000alikes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----\u2018s\u000aregiment.\u201d\u000a\u000aHis daughter\u2019s request, for such it might be considered, of being\u000aadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\u000areceived at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,\u000awho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\u2019s feelings and\u000aconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\u000aurged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\u000aand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\u000aprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their\u000amother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show\u000aher married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the\u000aNorth. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent\u000ahis permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as\u000athe ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was\u000asurprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and\u000ahad she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would\u000ahave been the last object of her wishes.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 51\u000a\u000a\u000aTheir sister\u2019s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her\u000aprobably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to\u000ameet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their\u000aarrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,\u000awho gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she\u000abeen the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\u000amust endure.\u000a\u000aThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive\u000athem. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to\u000athe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\u000aanxious, uneasy.\u000a\u000aLydia\u2019s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\u000ashe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\u000awelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,\u000ato Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an\u000aalacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.\u000a\u000aTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\u000aso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\u000aopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\u000aenough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet\u000awas shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,\u000aand fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their\u000acongratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly\u000around the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and\u000aobserved, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been\u000athere.\u000a\u000aWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners\u000awere always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been\u000aexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\u000aclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had\u000anot before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,\u000aresolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence\u000aof an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the\u000atwo who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.\u000a\u000aThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\u000aof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\u000aElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\u000awith a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her\u000areplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\u000aworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\u000avoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\u000athe world.\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly think of its being three months,\u201d she cried, \u201csince I went away;\u000ait seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things\u000aenough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\u000aI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\u000athought it would be very good fun if I was.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked\u000aexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of\u000awhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \u201cOh! mamma, do the\u000apeople hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;\u000aand we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he\u000ashould know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took\u000aoff my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that\u000ahe might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;\u000aand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\u000athe dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\u000aanxious parade, walk up to her mother\u2019s right hand, and hear her say\u000ato her eldest sister, \u201cAh! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go\u000alower, because I am a married woman.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment\u000afrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\u000aspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and\u000aall their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \u201cMrs. Wickham\u201d\u000a by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her\u000aring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, mamma,\u201d said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast\u000aroom, \u201cand what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I\u000aam sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half\u000amy good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get\u000ahusbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVery true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don\u2019t\u000aat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\u000athings. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We\u000ashall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some\u000aballs, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should like it beyond anything!\u201d said her mother.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\u000abehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\u000awinter is over.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thank you for my share of the favour,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut I do not\u000aparticularly like your way of getting husbands.\u201d\u000a\u000aTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\u000ahad received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\u000ahis regiment at the end of a fortnight.\u000a\u000aNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\u000ashe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\u000ahaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\u000aall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\u000athink, than such as did not.\u000a\u000aWickham\u2019s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected\u000ato find it; not equal to Lydia\u2019s for him. She had scarcely needed her\u000apresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\u000atheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather\u000athan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\u000afor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\u000athat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\u000aif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\u000aof having a companion.\u000a\u000aLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\u000aoccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every\u000athing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on\u000athe first of September, than any body else in the country.\u000a\u000aOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\u000aelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:\u000a\u000a\u201cLizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You\u000awere not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you\u000acurious to hear how it was managed?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo really,\u201d replied Elizabeth; \u201cI think there cannot be too little said\u000aon the subject.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLa! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\u000amarried, you know, at St. Clement\u2019s, because Wickham\u2019s lodgings were in\u000athat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\u000ao\u2019clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\u000awere to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in\u000asuch a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to\u000aput it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was\u000amy aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as\u000aif she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in\u000aten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed\u000ato know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\u000abe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\u000awere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you\u2019ll believe\u000ame, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\u000afortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was\u000arather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so\u000ajust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon\u000abusiness to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once\u000athey get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I\u000adid not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we\u000awere beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he\u000acame back again in ten minutes\u2019 time, and then we all set out. However,\u000aI recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the\u000awedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Darcy!\u201d repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious\u000ame! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\u000athem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it was to be secret,\u201d said Jane, \u201csay not another word on the\u000asubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! certainly,\u201d said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \u201cwe will\u000aask you no questions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThank you,\u201d said Lydia, \u201cfor if you did, I should certainly tell you\u000aall, and then Wickham would be angry.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\u000apower, by running away.\u000a\u000aBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least\u000ait was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at\u000aher sister\u2019s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\u000awhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\u000aConjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\u000abrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\u000aplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\u000acould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\u000awrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\u000aLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\u000aintended.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou may readily comprehend,\u201d she added, \u201cwhat my curiosity must be\u000ato know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively\u000aspeaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\u000aa time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\u000afor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems\u000ato think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\u000aignorance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot that I _shall_, though,\u201d she added to herself, as she finished\u000athe letter; \u201cand my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable\u000amanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it\u000aout.\u201d\u000a\u000aJane\u2019s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\u000aElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad\u000aof it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any\u000asatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 52\u000a\u000a\u000aElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as\u000asoon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it\u000athan, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to\u000abe interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to\u000abe happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\u000acontain a denial.\u000a\u000a\u201cGracechurch street, Sept. 6.\u000a\u000a\u201cMY DEAR NIECE,\u000a\u000a\u201cI have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning\u000ato answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise\u000awhat I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your\u000aapplication; I did not expect it from _you_. Don\u2019t think me angry,\u000ahowever, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such\u000ainquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to\u000aunderstand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised\u000aas I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned\u000awould have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really\u000ainnocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most\u000aunexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several\u000ahours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so\u000adreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.\u000aGardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,\u000aand that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,\u000aLydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\u000aafter ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\u000athem. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\u000ahimself that Wickham\u2019s worthlessness had not been so well known as to\u000amake it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide\u000ain him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and\u000aconfessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private\u000aactions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He\u000acalled it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy\u000aan evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_\u000amotive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days\u000ain town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to\u000adirect his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness\u000aof this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\u000agoverness to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause\u000aof disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large\u000ahouse in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\u000alodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with\u000aWickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to\u000atown. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\u000awanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and\u000acorruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.\u000aWickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had\u000ashe been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up\u000atheir abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the\u000awished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and\u000aafterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he\u000aacknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful\u000asituation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed\u000aon to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But\u000ahe found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared\u000afor none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear\u000aof leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\u000aother, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,\u000ait only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,\u000ain his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never\u000abeen _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,\u000aon account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and\u000ascrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia\u2019s flight on her\u000aown folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as\u000ato his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He\u000amust go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\u000anothing to live on.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though\u000aMr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able\u000ato do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by\u000amarriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still\u000acherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in\u000asome other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely\u000ato be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of\u000acourse wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be\u000areasonable.\u000a\u000a\u201cEvery thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\u2019s next step was to\u000amake your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\u000astreet the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be\u000aseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was\u000astill with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge\u000ayour father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your\u000auncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the\u000adeparture of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next\u000aday it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,\u000aand, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all\u000asettled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\u000aLongbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that\u000aobstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been\u000aaccused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.\u000aNothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and\u000aI do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your\u000auncle would most readily have settled the whole.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey battled it together for a long time, which was more than either\u000athe gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle\u000awas forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his\u000aniece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\u000awhich went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter\u000athis morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation\u000athat would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\u000ait was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane\u000aat most.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young\u000apeople. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably\u000amore than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own\u000asettled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all\u000athis was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It\u000awas owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\u000aWickham\u2019s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he\u000ahad been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth\u000ain _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody\u2019s_ reserve,\u000acan be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,\u000amy dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would\u000anever have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another\u000ainterest_ in the affair.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who\u000awere still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in\u000aLondon once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were\u000athen to receive the last finish.\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which\u000ayou tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not\u000aafford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant\u000aadmission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I\u000aknew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was\u000asatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not\u000aperceived, by Jane\u2019s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming\u000ahome was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell\u000ayou can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most\u000aserious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had\u000adone, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she\u000aheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was\u000asometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and\u000aJane, and for their sakes had patience with her.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,\u000aattended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave\u000atown again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my\u000adear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\u000aenough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,\u000ain every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His\u000aunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little\u000amore liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach\u000ahim. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But\u000aslyness seems the fashion.\u000a\u000a\u201cPray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\u000apunish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy\u000atill I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little\u000apair of ponies, would be the very thing.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half\u000ahour.\u000a\u000a\u201cYours, very sincerely,\u000a\u000a\u201cM. GARDINER.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\u000ain which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\u000agreatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\u000aproduced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\u2019s\u000amatch, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too\u000agreat to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the\u000apain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!\u000aHe had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all\u000athe trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which\u000asupplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and\u000adespise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason\u000awith, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to\u000aavoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had\u000adone all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her\u000aheart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly\u000achecked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity\u000awas insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for\u000aa woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so\u000anatural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law\u000aof Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,\u000ato be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had\u000agiven a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary\u000astretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been\u000awrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and\u000athough she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she\u000acould, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist\u000ahis endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially\u000aconcerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were\u000aunder obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They\u000aowed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!\u000ahow heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever\u000aencouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For\u000aherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause\u000aof compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.\u000aShe read over her aunt\u2019s commendation of him again and again. It\u000awas hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some\u000apleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she\u000aand her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted\u000abetween Mr. Darcy and herself.\u000a\u000aShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one\u2019s\u000aapproach; and before she could strike into another path, she was\u000aovertaken by Wickham.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\u201d said he,\u000aas he joined her.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou certainly do,\u201d she replied with a smile; \u201cbut it does not follow\u000athat the interruption must be unwelcome.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and\u000anow we are better.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTrue. Are the others coming out?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\u000aMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\u000ayou have actually seen Pemberley.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe replied in the affirmative.\u000a\u000a\u201cI almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\u000afor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\u000aold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\u000ame. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, she did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd what did she say?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\u000aout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\u000amisrepresented.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\u000asilenced him; but he soon afterwards said:\u000a\u000a\u201cI was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\u000aseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\u201d said\u000aElizabeth. \u201cIt must be something particular, to take him there at this\u000atime of year.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUndoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\u000aunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; he introduced us to his sister.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd do you like her?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVery much.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\u000aor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\u000ayou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid you go by the village of Kympton?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not recollect that we did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A\u000amost delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited\u000ame in every respect.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow should you have liked making sermons?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cExceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,\u000aand the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to\u000arepine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The\u000aquiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas\u000aof happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\u000acircumstance, when you were in Kent?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\u000aleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\u000afirst, you may remember.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not\u000aso palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\u000adeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\u000ahad been compromised accordingly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\u000awhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast\u000ato get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister\u2019s sake, to provoke him,\u000ashe only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:\u000a\u000a\u201cCome, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let\u000aus quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\u000amind.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though\u000ahe hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 53\u000a\u000a\u000aMr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he\u000anever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,\u000aby introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she\u000ahad said enough to keep him quiet.\u000a\u000aThe day of his and Lydia\u2019s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was\u000aforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means\u000aentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to\u000acontinue at least a twelvemonth.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! my dear Lydia,\u201d she cried, \u201cwhen shall we meet again?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, lord! I don\u2019t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWrite to me very often, my dear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for\u000awriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to\u000ado.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Wickham\u2019s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife\u2019s. He\u000asmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is as fine a fellow,\u201d said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\u000athe house, \u201cas ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to\u000aus all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas\u000ahimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\u000a\u000a\u201cI often think,\u201d said she, \u201cthat there is nothing so bad as parting with\u000aone\u2019s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\u201d said\u000aElizabeth. \u201cIt must make you better satisfied that your other four are\u000asingle.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,\u000abut only because her husband\u2019s regiment happens to be so far off. If\u000athat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly\u000arelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an\u000aarticle of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper\u000aat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\u000amaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\u000aweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\u000asmiled and shook her head by turns.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\u201d (for Mrs.\u000aPhillips first brought her the news). \u201cWell, so much the better. Not\u000athat I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am\u000asure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome\u000ato come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?\u000aBut that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to\u000amention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou may depend on it,\u201d replied the other, \u201cfor Mrs. Nicholls was in\u000aMeryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\u000ato know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He\u000acomes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\u000agoing to the butcher\u2019s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\u000aWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\u000acolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\u000aElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:\u000a\u000a\u201cI saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\u000areport; and I know I appeared distressed. But don\u2019t imagine it was from\u000aany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\u000aI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\u000ame either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\u000aalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\u000a_myself_, but I dread other people\u2019s remarks.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\u000aDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\u000aother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\u000ato Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\u000athere _with_ his friend\u2019s permission, or being bold enough to come\u000awithout it.\u000a\u000a\u201cYet it is hard,\u201d she sometimes thought, \u201cthat this poor man cannot\u000acome to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this\u000aspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\u000afeelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\u000aperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\u000amore unequal, than she had often seen them.\u000a\u000aThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\u000aabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cyou\u000awill wait on him of course.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\u000awent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\u000anothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\u2019s errand again.\u201d\u000a\u000aHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\u000awould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\u000aNetherfield.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Tis an etiquette I despise,\u201d said he. \u201cIf he wants our society,\u000alet him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours\u000ain running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back\u000aagain.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\u000aon him. But, however, that shan\u2019t prevent my asking him to dine here, I\u000aam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\u000amake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for\u000ahim.\u201d\u000a\u000aConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\u000ahusband\u2019s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\u000aneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\u000a_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\u000a\u000a\u201cI begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\u201d said Jane to her sister. \u201cIt\u000awould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can\u000ahardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\u000abut she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\u000asays. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI wish I could say anything to comfort you,\u201d replied Elizabeth; \u201cbut it\u000ais wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\u000aof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\u000aalways so much.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\u000acontrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\u000aand fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted\u000athe days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;\u000ahopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his\u000aarrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\u000aenter the paddock and ride towards the house.\u000a\u000aHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\u000akept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\u000ato the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\u000aagain by her sister.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a gentleman with him, mamma,\u201d said Kitty; \u201cwho can it be?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSome acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\u000aknow.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLa!\u201d replied Kitty, \u201cit looks just like that man that used to be with\u000ahim before. Mr. what\u2019s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\u000aMr. Bingley\u2019s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\u000asay that I hate the very sight of him.\u201d\u000a\u000aJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\u000aof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\u000awhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\u000aafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\u000aenough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\u000amother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\u000acivil to him only as Mr. Bingley\u2019s friend, without being heard by either\u000aof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\u000asuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\u000aGardiner\u2019s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\u000aTo Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\u000aand whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\u000ainformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\u000afor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\u000ainterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as\u000awhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\u000acoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\u000awas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\u000abehaviour in Derbyshire.\u000a\u000aThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a\u000aminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\u000aher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\u000awishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\u000a\u000a\u201cLet me first see how he behaves,\u201d said she; \u201cit will then be early\u000aenough for expectation.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\u000alift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of\u000aher sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\u000apaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\u000agentlemen\u2019s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\u000atolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\u000asymptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\u000a\u000aElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\u000aagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\u000ahad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,\u000ashe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\u000ashe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother\u2019s\u000apresence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but\u000anot an improbable, conjecture.\u000a\u000aBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\u000asaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\u000aBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\u000aespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\u000aher curtsey and address to his friend.\u000a\u000aElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter\u000athe preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,\u000awas hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\u000aapplied.\u000a\u000aDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question\u000awhich she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He\u000awas not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\u000ait had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,\u000awhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without\u000abringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\u000athe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\u000afound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\u000athe ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\u000athey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\u000awith herself for being so.\u000a\u000a\u201cCould I expect it to be otherwise!\u201d said she. \u201cYet why did he come?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to\u000ahim she had hardly courage to speak.\u000a\u000aShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet.\u000a\u000aHe readily agreed to it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say\u000ayou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\u000ait is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,\u000asince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my\u000aown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\u000aseen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;\u000athough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, \u2018Lately,\u000aGeorge Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,\u2019 without there being a\u000asyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\u000aIt was my brother Gardiner\u2019s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\u000amake such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\u201d\u000a\u000aBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\u000adared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\u000anot tell.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\u201d\u000a continued her mother, \u201cbut at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\u000ahard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to\u000aNewcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay\u000aI do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have\u000aheard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\u000aregulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so\u000amany as he deserves.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such\u000amisery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,\u000ahowever, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\u000adone before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in\u000athe country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\u201d said her mother,\u000a\u201cI beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\u000aBennet\u2019s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\u000awill save all the best of the covies for you.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth\u2019s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\u000aattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had\u000aflattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be\u000ahastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt\u000athat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\u000amoments of such painful confusion.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe first wish of my heart,\u201d said she to herself, \u201cis never more to\u000abe in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\u000athat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\u000aone or the other again!\u201d\u000a\u000aYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\u000acompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing\u000ahow much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her\u000aformer lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\u000abut every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He\u000afound her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and\u000aas unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\u000adifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\u000athat she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,\u000athat she did not always know when she was silent.\u000a\u000aWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her\u000aintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at\u000aLongbourn in a few days time.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,\u201d she added, \u201cfor when\u000ayou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with\u000aus, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure\u000ayou, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep\u000ayour engagement.\u201d\u000a\u000aBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\u000ahis concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\u000athere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\u000anot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man\u000aon whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride\u000aof one who had ten thousand a year.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 54\u000a\u000a\u000aAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;\u000aor in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that\u000amust deaden them more. Mr. Darcy\u2019s behaviour astonished and vexed her.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\u201d said she,\u000a\u201cdid he come at all?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when\u000ahe was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If\u000ahe no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will\u000athink no more about him.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach\u000aof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her\u000abetter satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow,\u201d said she, \u201cthat this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly\u000aeasy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by\u000ahis coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly\u000aseen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent\u000aacquaintance.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, very indifferent indeed,\u201d said Elizabeth, laughingly. \u201cOh, Jane,\u000atake care.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with\u000ayou as ever.\u201d\u000a\u000a                          * * * * *\u000a\u000aThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\u000athe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good\u000ahumour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour\u2019s visit, had\u000arevived.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\u000awho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality\u000aas sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\u000adining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\u000athe place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\u000aher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore\u000ato invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\u000ahesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\u000adecided. He placed himself by her.\u000a\u000aElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.\u000aHe bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that\u000aBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\u000alikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\u000aalarm.\u000a\u000aHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an\u000aadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\u000aElizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane\u2019s happiness, and his\u000aown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\u000aconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\u000agave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\u000ano cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\u000acould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\u000asuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\u000aadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but\u000ashe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\u000acold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother\u2019s ungraciousness,\u000amade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth\u2019s mind;\u000aand she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\u000ahim that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the\u000afamily.\u000a\u000aShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\u000abringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\u000awithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than\u000athe mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious\u000aand uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the\u000agentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her\u000auncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\u000aher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf he does not come to me, _then_,\u201d said she, \u201cI shall give him up for\u000aever.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\u000aanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\u000awhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\u000ain so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her\u000awhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen\u2019s approaching, one of\u000athe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:\u000a\u000a\u201cThe men shan\u2019t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\u000ado we?\u201d\u000a\u000aDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\u000aher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\u000ato help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for\u000abeing so silly!\u000a\u000a\u201cA man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\u000aexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not\u000aprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\u000aThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\u201d\u000a\u000aShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup\u000ahimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:\u000a\u000a\u201cIs your sister at Pemberley still?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, she will remain there till Christmas.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,\u000athese three weeks.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\u000awith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\u000asome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady\u2019s whispering\u000ato Elizabeth again, he walked away.\u000a\u000aWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies\u000aall rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,\u000awhen all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her\u000amother\u2019s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\u000awith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\u000aThey were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had\u000anothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\u000aof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\u000asupper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the\u000aothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell girls,\u201d said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \u201cWhat\u000asay you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,\u000aI assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\u000avenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so\u000afat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\u000aLucases\u2019 last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\u000awere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\u000acooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\u000abeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\u000awhat do you think she said besides? \u2018Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\u000aat Netherfield at last.\u2019 She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good\u000aa creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,\u000aand not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of\u000aBingley\u2019s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at\u000alast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\u000ahumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\u000anot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt has been a very agreeable day,\u201d said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \u201cThe\u000aparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\u000amay often meet again.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth smiled.\u000a\u000a\u201cLizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.\u000aI assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\u000aagreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am\u000aperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\u000aany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed\u000awith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\u000apleasing, than any other man.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are very cruel,\u201d said her sister, \u201cyou will not let me smile, and\u000aare provoking me to it every moment.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow hard it is in some cases to be believed!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd how impossible in others!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\u000aacknowledge?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to\u000ainstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive\u000ame; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 55\u000a\u000a\u000aA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His\u000afriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in\u000aten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\u000agood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\u000aexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\u000a\u000a\u201cNext time you call,\u201d said she, \u201cI hope we shall be more lucky.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would\u000agive him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.\u000a\u000a\u201cCan you come to-morrow?\u201d\u000a\u000aYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\u000aaccepted with alacrity.\u000a\u000aHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them\u000adressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\u2019s room, in her dressing\u000agown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\u000acome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\u000aBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\u000aLizzy\u2019s hair.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will be down as soon as we can,\u201d said Jane; \u201cbut I dare say Kitty is\u000aforwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!\u000aWhere is your sash, my dear?\u201d\u000a\u000aBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\u000awithout one of her sisters.\u000a\u000aThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\u000aevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\u000acustom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of\u000athe five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\u000aElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\u000aimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\u000aKitty did, she very innocently said, \u201cWhat is the matter mamma? What do\u000ayou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\u201d She then sat still\u000afive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\u000asuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \u201cCome here, my love, I want to\u000aspeak to you,\u201d took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look\u000aat Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her\u000aentreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.\u000aBennet half-opened the door and called out:\u000a\u000a\u201cLizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was forced to go.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe may as well leave them by themselves you know;\u201d said her mother, as\u000asoon as she was in the hall. \u201cKitty and I are going up stairs to sit in\u000amy dressing-room.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\u000aquietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\u000ainto the drawing-room.\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet\u2019s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every\u000athing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His\u000aease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their\u000aevening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the\u000amother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command\u000aof countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.\u000a\u000aHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went\u000aaway, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.\u000aBennet\u2019s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\u000a\u000aAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\u000abetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in\u000athe happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\u000areturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\u000apersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman\u2019s\u000aconcurrence.\u000a\u000aBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent\u000athe morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\u000aagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\u000aor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\u000asilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\u000aother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\u000aand in the evening Mrs. Bennet\u2019s invention was again at work to get\u000aevery body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\u000ato write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\u000afor as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\u000awanted to counteract her mother\u2019s schemes.\u000a\u000aBut on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she\u000asaw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\u000ahad been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her\u000asister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\u000aearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\u000aboth, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would\u000ahave told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she\u000athought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\u000aElizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as\u000awell as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\u000awords to her sister, ran out of the room.\u000a\u000aJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\u000apleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\u000aemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Tis too much!\u201d she added, \u201cby far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!\u000awhy is not everybody as happy?\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth\u2019s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,\u000aa delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\u000akindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\u000aallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\u000asaid for the present.\u000a\u000a\u201cI must go instantly to my mother;\u201d she cried. \u201cI would not on any\u000aaccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\u000afrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to\u000aknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\u000afamily! how shall I bear so much happiness!\u201d\u000a\u000aShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\u000acard party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\u000a\u000aElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\u000awith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\u000aprevious months of suspense and vexation.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd this,\u201d said she, \u201cis the end of all his friend\u2019s anxious\u000acircumspection! of all his sister\u2019s falsehood and contrivance! the\u000ahappiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\u000afather had been short and to the purpose.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere is your sister?\u201d said he hastily, as he opened the door.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\u000aand affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed\u000aher delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\u000agreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\u000ato all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\u2019s perfections;\u000aand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\u000aexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\u000abasis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of\u000aJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\u000ahimself.\u000a\u000aIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\u000aMiss Bennet\u2019s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as\u000amade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\u000aher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or\u000aspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\u000athough she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when\u000aMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\u000ahow really happy he was.\u000a\u000aNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\u000avisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\u000aturned to his daughter, and said:\u000a\u000a\u201cJane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\u201d\u000a\u000aJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\u000agoodness.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are a good girl;\u201d he replied, \u201cand I have great pleasure in\u000athinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\u000adoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\u000aeach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\u000aeasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\u000aalways exceed your income.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\u000aunpardonable in me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cExceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d cried his wife, \u201cwhat are you\u000atalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\u000amore.\u201d Then addressing her daughter, \u201cOh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so\u000ahappy! I am sure I shan\u2019t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\u000awould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\u000abe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\u000ahe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\u000athat you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\u000aever was seen!\u201d\u000a\u000aWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\u000afavourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger\u000asisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\u000awhich she might in future be able to dispense.\u000a\u000aMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\u000abegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\u000a\u000aBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\u000acoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\u000asupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\u000adetested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself\u000aobliged to accept.\u000a\u000aElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\u000awhile he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;\u000abut she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours\u000aof separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he\u000aalways attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of\u000aher; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of\u000arelief.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe has made me so happy,\u201d said she, one evening, \u201cby telling me that he\u000awas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\u000ait possible.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI suspected as much,\u201d replied Elizabeth. \u201cBut how did he account for\u000ait?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt must have been his sister\u2019s doing. They were certainly no friends to\u000ahis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\u000achosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\u000aas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\u000alearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\u000acan never be what we once were to each other.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is the most unforgiving speech,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat I ever\u000aheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\u000athe dupe of Miss Bingley\u2019s pretended regard.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWould you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\u000ahe really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being\u000aindifferent would have prevented his coming down again!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\u000amodesty.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\u000athe little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased\u000ato find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,\u000athough Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she\u000aknew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\u201d cried\u000aJane. \u201cOh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\u000aabove them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but\u000asuch another man for you!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as\u000ayou. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\u000ahappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\u000agood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\u000asecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,\u000aand she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\u000aneighbours in Meryton.\u000a\u000aThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\u000aworld, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\u000athey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 56\u000a\u000a\u000aOne morning, about a week after Bingley\u2019s engagement with Jane had been\u000aformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\u000adining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the\u000asound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up\u000athe lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\u000aequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\u000awere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\u000apreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\u000asomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\u000athe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\u000ashrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\u000acontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\u000aopen and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\u000a\u000aThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\u000aastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\u000aBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\u000ainferior to what Elizabeth felt.\u000a\u000aShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\u000aother reply to Elizabeth\u2019s salutation than a slight inclination of the\u000ahead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\u000aname to her mother on her ladyship\u2019s entrance, though no request of\u000aintroduction had been made.\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\u000ahigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\u000afor a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\u000amother.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, madam,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.\u000a\u201cShe is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\u000aand my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man\u000awho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have a very small park here,\u201d returned Lady Catherine after a short\u000asilence.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I\u000aassure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\u000asummer; the windows are full west.\u201d\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then\u000aadded:\u000a\u000a\u201cMay I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and\u000aMrs. Collins well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\u000aCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\u000aletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\u000a\u000aMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\u000arefreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\u000adeclined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\u000aon one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\u000awill favour me with your company.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGo, my dear,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cand show her ladyship about the\u000adifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\u000aattended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the\u000ahall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\u000adrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent\u000alooking rooms, walked on.\u000a\u000aHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\u000awaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\u000athat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\u000aconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\u000adisagreeable.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow could I ever think her like her nephew?\u201d said she, as she looked in\u000aher face.\u000a\u000aAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\u000amanner:--\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\u000ajourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\u000acome.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account\u000afor the honour of seeing you here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Bennet,\u201d replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \u201cyou ought to\u000aknow, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\u000achoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\u000acelebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such\u000amoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\u000aalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your\u000asister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\u000ayou, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon\u000aafterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\u000a_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\u000aso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved\u000aon setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\u000ayou.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you believed it impossible to be true,\u201d said Elizabeth, colouring\u000awith astonishment and disdain, \u201cI wonder you took the trouble of coming\u000aso far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\u201d said Elizabeth\u000acoolly, \u201cwill be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report\u000ais in existence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\u000aindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\u000areport is spread abroad?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never heard that it was.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may\u000aask questions which I shall not choose to answer.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\u000ahe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\u000areason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\u000ahave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\u000amay have drawn him in.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\u000alanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\u000aand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,\u000aever induce me to be explicit.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\u000apresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\u000aengaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\u000amake an offer to me.\u201d\u000a\u000aLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\u000a\u000a\u201cThe engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\u000athey have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\u000a_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned\u000athe union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\u000abe accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\u000ainferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\u000athe family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his\u000atacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\u000apropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest\u000ahours he was destined for his cousin?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is\u000ano other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not\u000abe kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to\u000amarry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\u000amarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither\u000aby honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\u000aanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBecause honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,\u000aMiss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\u000afriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\u000abe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\u000aYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\u000aby any of us.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are heavy misfortunes,\u201d replied Elizabeth. \u201cBut the wife of Mr.\u000aDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\u000aattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\u000ato repine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cObstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\u000afor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\u000ascore? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\u000ahere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will\u000aI be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person\u2019s\u000awhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_That_ will make your ladyship\u2019s situation at present more pitiable;\u000abut it will have no effect on me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\u000anephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\u000aside, from the same noble line; and, on the father\u2019s, from respectable,\u000ahonourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on\u000aboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\u000aevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?\u000aThe upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,\u000aor fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you\u000awere sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in\u000awhich you have been brought up.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\u000asphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\u2019s daughter; so far we are\u000aequal.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTrue. You _are_ a gentleman\u2019s daughter. But who was your mother?\u000aWho are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\u000acondition.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhatever my connections may be,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cif your nephew does\u000anot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\u201d\u000a\u000aThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\u000aCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\u000amoment\u2019s deliberation:\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not.\u201d\u000a\u000aLady Catherine seemed pleased.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will make no promise of the kind.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\u000areasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that\u000aI will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\u000aassurance I require.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\u000aanything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\u000ayour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their\u000amarriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would\u000amy refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\u000aAllow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have\u000asupported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the\u000aapplication was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if\u000ayou think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your\u000anephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;\u000abut you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,\u000atherefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\u000aobjections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am\u000ano stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister\u2019s infamous\u000aelopement. I know it all; that the young man\u2019s marrying her was a\u000apatched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is\u000asuch a girl to be my nephew\u2019s sister? Is her husband, is the son of his\u000alate father\u2019s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are\u000ayou thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can now have nothing further to say,\u201d she resentfully answered.\u000a\u201cYou have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to\u000athe house.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\u000aback. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\u000aUnfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you\u000amust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are then resolved to have him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\u000awhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\u000areference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\u000aclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\u000athe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNeither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201chave any\u000apossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either\u000awould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\u000aresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\u000a_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment\u2019s\u000aconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\u000athe scorn.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.\u000aI shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\u000aambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\u000areasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of\u000athe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, \u201cI take no leave\u000aof you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve\u000ano such attention. I am most seriously displeased.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\u000aladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She\u000aheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother\u000aimpatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady\u000aCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe did not choose it,\u201d said her daughter, \u201cshe would go.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\u000acivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were\u000awell. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through\u000aMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had\u000anothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to\u000aacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 57\u000a\u000a\u000aThe discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\u000aElizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many\u000ahours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\u000aappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,\u000afor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\u000aDarcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report\u000aof their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\u000atill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\u000aand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\u000aexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\u000athe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\u000asister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours\u000aat Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the\u000aCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had\u000aonly set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked\u000aforward to as possible at some future time.\u000a\u000aIn revolving Lady Catherine\u2019s expressions, however, she could not help\u000afeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\u000ain this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\u000aprevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate\u000aan application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar\u000arepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\u000anot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\u000aaunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\u000athat he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\u000awas certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,\u000awhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\u000aaddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\u000aprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\u000aand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\u000a\u000aIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often\u000aseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\u000asettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\u000aunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\u000aCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\u000aBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his\u000afriend within a few days,\u201d she added, \u201cI shall know how to understand\u000ait. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\u000aconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\u000ahave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\u000aat all.\u201d\u000a\u000a                          * * * * *\u000a\u000aThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\u000abeen, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same\u000akind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet\u2019s curiosity; and\u000aElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\u000a\u000aThe next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her\u000afather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cLizzy,\u201d said he, \u201cI was going to look for you; come into my room.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to\u000atell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner\u000aconnected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it\u000amight be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the\u000aconsequent explanations.\u000a\u000aShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He\u000athen said,\u000a\u000a\u201cI have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\u000aexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\u000acontents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink\u000aof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth\u2019s cheeks in the instantaneous\u000aconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\u000aand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\u000ahimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\u000aherself; when her father continued:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\u000aas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the\u000aname of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSomething very much to the purpose of course. He begins with\u000acongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\u000awhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping\u000aLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says\u000aon that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: \u2018Having thus\u000aoffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\u000athis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;\u000aof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\u000aElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\u000aher elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may\u000abe reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in\u000athis land.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cCan you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? \u2018This young\u000agentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of\u000amortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive\u000apatronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin\u000aElizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate\u000aclosure with this gentleman\u2019s proposals, which, of course, you will be\u000ainclined to take immediate advantage of.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cHave you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine\u000athat his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with\u000aa friendly eye.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\u000asurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within\u000athe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie\u000amore effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\u000awoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his\u000alife! It is admirable!\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth tried to join in her father\u2019s pleasantry, but could only force\u000aone most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\u000alittle agreeable to her.\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you not diverted?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! yes. Pray read on.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last\u000anight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\u000afelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some\u000afamily objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\u000aconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty\u000ato give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and\u000aher noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\u000ahastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\u2019 Mr.\u000aCollins moreover adds, \u2018I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia\u2019s sad\u000abusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\u000aliving together before the marriage took place should be so generally\u000aknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\u000afrom declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young\u000acouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\u000aencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\u000avery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,\u000aas a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\u000anames to be mentioned in your hearing.\u2019 That is his notion of Christian\u000aforgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte\u2019s\u000asituation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you\u000alook as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,\u000aI hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we\u000alive, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our\u000aturn?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh!\u201d cried Elizabeth, \u201cI am excessively diverted. But it is so\u000astrange!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\u000ait would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_\u000apointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\u000awriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins\u2019s correspondence for any\u000aconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\u000ahim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\u000ahypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\u000aabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\u201d\u000a\u000aTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\u000abeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by\u000ahis repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\u000afeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she\u000awould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by\u000awhat he said of Mr. Darcy\u2019s indifference, and she could do nothing but\u000awonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of\u000ahis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 58\u000a\u000a\u000aInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as\u000aElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy\u000awith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine\u2019s\u000avisit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time\u000ato tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat\u000ain momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\u000atheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\u000ahabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five\u000aset off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others\u000ato outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy\u000awere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty\u000awas too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\u000adesperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\u000a\u000aThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon\u000aMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\u000awhen Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the\u000amoment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was\u000ahigh, she immediately said:\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving\u000arelief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I\u000acan no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my\u000apoor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to\u000aacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\u000aof my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\u201d replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\u000aand emotion, \u201cthat you have ever been informed of what may, in a\u000amistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\u000awas so little to be trusted.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must not blame my aunt. Lydia\u2019s thoughtlessness first betrayed to\u000ame that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\u000anot rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\u000ain the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\u000ayou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\u000asake of discovering them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you _will_ thank me,\u201d he replied, \u201clet it be for yourself alone.\u000aThat the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other\u000ainducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your\u000a_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought\u000aonly of _you_.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\u000aher companion added, \u201cYou are too generous to trifle with me. If your\u000afeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\u000aaffections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence\u000ame on this subject for ever.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\u000ahis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\u000avery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone\u000aso material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make\u000aher receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\u000ahappiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\u000afelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\u000awarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\u000abeen able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the\u000aexpression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;\u000abut, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of\u000afeelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\u000aaffection every moment more valuable.\u000a\u000aThey walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\u000abe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\u000asoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\u000ato the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through\u000aLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\u000asubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\u000aevery expression of the latter which, in her ladyship\u2019s apprehension,\u000apeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that\u000asuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise\u000afrom her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\u000aladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt taught me to hope,\u201d said he, \u201cas I had scarcely ever allowed myself\u000ato hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,\u000ahad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\u000aacknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \u201cYes, you know enough\u000aof my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\u000aabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\u000ayour relations.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your\u000aaccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my\u000abehaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\u000aunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\u000aevening,\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cThe conduct of neither, if strictly examined,\u000awill be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved\u000ain civility.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\u000athen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\u000ait, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\u000areproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: \u2018had you behaved in a\u000amore gentlemanlike manner.\u2019 Those were your words. You know not, you can\u000ascarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,\u000aI confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\u000aimpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\u000aa way.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\u000afeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\u000aforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\u000away that would induce you to accept me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\u000aall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aDarcy mentioned his letter. \u201cDid it,\u201d said he, \u201cdid it soon make you\u000athink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\u000acontents?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her\u000aformer prejudices had been removed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI knew,\u201d said he, \u201cthat what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\u000anecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part\u000aespecially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the\u000apower of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might\u000ajustly make you hate me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\u000apreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\u000aopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\u000achanged as that implies.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I wrote that letter,\u201d replied Darcy, \u201cI believed myself perfectly\u000acalm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a\u000adreadful bitterness of spirit.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\u000aadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\u000aof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now\u000aso widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\u000acircumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some\u000aof my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\u000apleasure.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your\u000aretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\u000aarising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\u000ainnocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude\u000awhich cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish\u000abeing all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I\u000awas taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I\u000awas given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\u000aUnfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt\u000aby my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all\u000athat was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught\u000ame to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family\u000acircle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least\u000ato think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I\u000awas, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been\u000abut for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You\u000ataught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,\u000aI was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.\u000aYou showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman\u000aworthy of being pleased.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHad you then persuaded yourself that I should?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\u000awishing, expecting my addresses.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\u000ayou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\u000awrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take\u000aa proper direction.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at\u000aPemberley. You blamed me for coming?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\u000aMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\u000aconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy object then,\u201d replied Darcy, \u201cwas to show you, by every civility in\u000amy power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to\u000aobtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\u000asee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\u000aintroduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an\u000ahour after I had seen you.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe then told her of Georgiana\u2019s delight in her acquaintance, and of her\u000adisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\u000athe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\u000afollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\u000abefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness\u000athere had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\u000acomprehend.\u000a\u000aShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\u000aeach, to be dwelt on farther.\u000a\u000aAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\u000aanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that\u000ait was time to be at home.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\u201d was a wonder which\u000aintroduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with\u000atheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of\u000ait.\u000a\u000a\u201cI must ask whether you were surprised?\u201d said Elizabeth.\u000a\u000a\u201cNot at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.\u201d And\u000athough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much\u000athe case.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn the evening before my going to London,\u201d said he, \u201cI made a\u000aconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I\u000atold him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\u000aaffairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had\u000athe slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\u000amistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\u000ato him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\u000aunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his\u000afriend.\u000a\u000a\u201cDid you speak from your own observation,\u201d said she, \u201cwhen you told him\u000athat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits\u000awhich I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\u000ahim.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\u000aprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\u000ahis reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess\u000aone thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\u000aallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\u000alast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\u000aangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\u000ain any doubt of your sister\u2019s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\u000anow.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\u000afriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\u000aherself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,\u000aand it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness\u000aof Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he\u000acontinued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they\u000aparted.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 59\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\u201d was a question\u000awhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,\u000aand from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to\u000asay in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own\u000aknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything\u000aelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\u000a\u000aThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The\u000aacknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.\u000aDarcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\u000aand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy\u000athan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\u000athere were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt\u000ain the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no\u000aone liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\u000adislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\u000a\u000aAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\u000afrom Miss Bennet\u2019s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\u000ayou shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and\u000aI am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am\u000ain earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are\u000aengaged.\u201d\u000a\u000aJane looked at her doubtingly. \u201cOh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\u000ayou dislike him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\u000adid not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as\u000athese, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\u000aremember it myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\u000aseriously assured her of its truth.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,\u201d cried\u000aJane. \u201cMy dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you\u000acertain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\u000ahappy with him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that\u000awe are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,\u000aJane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVery, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\u000adelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\u000areally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\u000amarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\u000ato do?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I\u000atell you all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\u000aafraid you will be angry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let\u000ame know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me\u000ahow long you have loved him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.\u000aBut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\u000aat Pemberley.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\u000adesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances\u000aof attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\u000afurther to wish.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow I am quite happy,\u201d said she, \u201cfor you will be as happy as myself.\u000aI always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,\u000aI must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\u2019s friend and your\u000ahusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But\u000aLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\u000atell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\u000aof it to another, not to you.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling\u000ato mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\u000aher equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer\u000aconceal from her his share in Lydia\u2019s marriage. All was acknowledged,\u000aand half the night spent in conversation.\u000a\u000a                          * * * * *\u000a\u000a\u201cGood gracious!\u201d cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next\u000amorning, \u201cif that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with\u000aour dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always\u000acoming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or\u000aother, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?\u000aLizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\u2019s\u000away.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\u000awas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\u000aepithet.\u000a\u000aAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\u000ashook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\u000aand he soon afterwards said aloud, \u201cMrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\u000ahereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cto walk\u000ato Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\u000anever seen the view.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt may do very well for the others,\u201d replied Mr. Bingley; \u201cbut I am\u000asure it will be too much for Kitty. Won\u2019t it, Kitty?\u201d Kitty owned that\u000ashe had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see\u000athe view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went\u000aup stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:\u000a\u000a\u201cI am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\u000adisagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is\u000aall for Jane\u2019s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking\u000ato him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to\u000ainconvenience.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\u2019s consent should be\u000aasked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the\u000aapplication for her mother\u2019s. She could not determine how her mother\u000awould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\u000awould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she\u000awere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\u000awas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit\u000ato her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear\u000athe first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\u000adisapprobation.\u000a\u000a                          * * * * *\u000a\u000aIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\u000aMr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\u000aextreme. She did not fear her father\u2019s opposition, but he was going to\u000abe made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,\u000ahis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\u000afilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched\u000areflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\u000alooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\u000ahe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\u000apretending to admire her work said in a whisper, \u201cGo to your father, he\u000awants you in the library.\u201d She was gone directly.\u000a\u000aHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\u000a\u201cLizzy,\u201d said he, \u201cwhat are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be\u000aaccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\u201d\u000a\u000aHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\u000areasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\u000aexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\u000abut they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\u000aof her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\u000a\u000a\u201cOr, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\u000asure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\u000aBut will they make you happy?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHave you any other objection,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthan your belief of my\u000aindifference?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNone at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\u000athis would be nothing if you really liked him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do, I do like him,\u201d she replied, with tears in her eyes, \u201cI love him.\u000aIndeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\u000aknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\u000asuch terms.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLizzy,\u201d said her father, \u201cI have given him my consent. He is the kind\u000aof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\u000acondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\u000ahaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know\u000ayour disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\u000arespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked\u000aup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\u000agreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\u000adiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\u000a_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\u000aabout.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and\u000aat length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object\u000aof her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of\u000ahim had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection\u000awas not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months\u2019\u000asuspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did\u000aconquer her father\u2019s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, my dear,\u201d said he, when she ceased speaking, \u201cI have no more to\u000asay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\u000ayou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\u000ahad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;\u000amade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow\u2019s debts, and got him\u000ahis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\u000aand economy. Had it been your uncle\u2019s doing, I must and _would_ have\u000apaid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own\u000away. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about\u000ahis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading\u000aMr. Collins\u2019s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\u000aat last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, \u201cIf any young men come\u000afor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\u201d\u000a\u000aElizabeth\u2019s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\u000ahalf an hour\u2019s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\u000athe others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for\u000agaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\u000aanything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\u000awould come in time.\u000a\u000aWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\u000aand made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;\u000afor on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to\u000autter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could\u000acomprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit\u000awhat was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\u000alover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\u000aher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\u000ahave thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\u000aand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\u000ayou will have! Jane\u2019s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\u000apleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my\u000adear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I\u000ahope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing\u000athat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\u000aLord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and\u000aElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\u000asoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\u000aher mother followed her.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dearest child,\u201d she cried, \u201cI can think of nothing else! Ten\u000athousand a year, and very likely more! \u2018Tis as good as a Lord! And a\u000aspecial licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But\u000amy dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,\u000athat I may have it to-morrow.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis was a sad omen of what her mother\u2019s behaviour to the gentleman\u000ahimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain\u000apossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations\u2019\u000aconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\u000apassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\u000ain such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to\u000ahim, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her\u000adeference for his opinion.\u000a\u000aElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\u000aacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising\u000aevery hour in his esteem.\u000a\u000a\u201cI admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\u201d said he. \u201cWickham, perhaps,\u000ais my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well\u000aas Jane\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 60\u000a\u000a\u000aElizabeth\u2019s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.\u000aDarcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. \u201cHow could\u000ayou begin?\u201d said she. \u201cI can comprehend your going on charmingly, when\u000ayou had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first\u000aplace?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which\u000alaid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I\u000aknew that I _had_ begun.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour\u000ato _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke\u000ato you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;\u000adid you admire me for my impertinence?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor the liveliness of your mind, I did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.\u000aThe fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious\u000aattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,\u000aand looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and\u000ainterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really\u000aamiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you\u000atook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and\u000ain your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\u000acourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for\u000ait; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly\u000areasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks\u000aof _that_ when they fall in love.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWas there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was\u000aill at Netherfield?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it\u000aby all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are\u000ato exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me\u000ato find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may\u000abe; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling\u000ato come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first\u000acalled, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did\u000ayou look as if you did not care about me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBecause you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I was embarrassed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd so was I.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA man who had felt less, might.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that\u000aI should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you\u000a_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when\u000ayou _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of\u000athanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.\u000a_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort\u000asprings from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the\u000asubject. This will never do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady\u000aCatherine\u2019s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of\u000aremoving all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to\u000ayour eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour\u000ato wait for any opening of yours. My aunt\u2019s intelligence had given me\u000ahope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,\u000afor she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to\u000aNetherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?\u000aor had you intended any more serious consequence?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I\u000amight ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to\u000amyself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,\u000aand if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to\u000abefall her?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it\u000aought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be\u000adone directly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and\u000aadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But\u000aI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy\u000ahad been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s\u000along letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would\u000abe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and\u000aaunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as\u000afollows:\u000a\u000a\u201cI would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,\u000afor your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the\u000atruth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.\u000aBut _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your\u000afancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the\u000asubject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you\u000acannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a\u000agreat deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,\u000afor not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your\u000aidea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I\u000aam the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so\u000abefore, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she\u000aonly smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that\u000ahe can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.\u000aYours, etc.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Darcy\u2019s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still\u000adifferent from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply\u000ato his last.\u000a\u000a\u201cDEAR SIR,\u000a\u000a\u201cI must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon\u000abe the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.\u000aBut, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.\u000a\u000a\u201cYours sincerely, etc.\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Bingley\u2019s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching\u000amarriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even\u000ato Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her\u000aformer professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was\u000aaffected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing\u000aher a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.\u000a\u000aThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,\u000awas as sincere as her brother\u2019s in sending it. Four sides of paper were\u000ainsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\u000abeing loved by her sister.\u000a\u000aBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\u000ato Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the\u000aCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this\u000asudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered\u000aso exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew\u2019s letter, that\u000aCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\u000athe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\u000awas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\u000ameetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\u000asaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of\u000aher husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\u000alisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\u000athe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\u000ameeting frequently at St. James\u2019s, with very decent composure. If he did\u000ashrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\u000a\u000aMrs. Phillips\u2019s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his\u000aforbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in\u000atoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley\u2019s good\u000ahumour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.\u000aNor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all\u000alikely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield\u000ahim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep\u000ahim to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\u000awithout mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising\u000afrom all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it\u000aadded to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to\u000athe time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing\u000ato either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at\u000aPemberley.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aChapter 61\u000a\u000a\u000aHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got\u000arid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride\u000ashe afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may\u000abe guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the\u000aaccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many\u000aof her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,\u000aamiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it\u000awas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity\u000ain so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and\u000ainvariably silly.\u000a\u000aMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her\u000adrew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in\u000agoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\u000a\u000aMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near\u000aa vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to\u000a_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his\u000asisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county\u000ato Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source\u000aof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\u000a\u000aKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with\u000aher two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally\u000aknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a\u000atemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia\u2019s example,\u000ashe became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less\u000aignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia\u2019s\u000asociety she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham\u000afrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of\u000aballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\u000a\u000aMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily\u000adrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet\u2019s being quite\u000aunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but\u000ashe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no\u000alonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters\u2019 beauty and her own,\u000ait was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without\u000amuch reluctance.\u000a\u000aAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from\u000athe marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that\u000aElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\u000aand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every\u000athing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on\u000ato make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received\u000afrom Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,\u000aif not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this\u000aeffect:\u000a\u000a\u201cMY DEAR LIZZY,\u000a\u000a\u201cI wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear\u000aWickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so\u000arich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.\u000aI am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not\u000athink we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.\u000aAny place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,\u000ado not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\u000a\u000a\u201cYours, etc.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in\u000aher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\u000aSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\u000aof what might be called economy in her own private expences, she\u000afrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\u000aincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\u000atheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\u000atheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\u000aherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance\u000atowards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\u000arestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\u000aextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap\u000asituation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for\u000aher soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and\u000ain spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\u000areputation which her marriage had given her.\u000a\u000aThough Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for\u000aElizabeth\u2019s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was\u000aoccasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself\u000ain London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently\u000astaid so long, that even Bingley\u2019s good humour was overcome, and he\u000aproceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.\u000a\u000aMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\u2019s marriage; but as she\u000athought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she\u000adropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as\u000aattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility\u000ato Elizabeth.\u000a\u000aPemberley was now Georgiana\u2019s home; and the attachment of the sisters\u000awas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each\u000aother even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\u000ain the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with\u000aan astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of\u000atalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\u000awhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\u000apleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen\u000ain her way. By Elizabeth\u2019s instructions, she began to comprehend that\u000aa woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not\u000aalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\u000a\u000aLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;\u000aand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in\u000aher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him\u000alanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\u000aall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth\u2019s persuasion,\u000ahe was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\u000aand, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her\u000aresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\u000ato see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait\u000aon them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\u000areceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\u000avisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\u000a\u000aWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.\u000aDarcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever\u000asensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing\u000aher into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen\u000a\u000a*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***\u000a\u000a***** This file should be named 1342-0.txt or 1342-0.zip *****\u000aThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\u000a        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/3/4/1342/\u000a\u000aProduced by Anonymous Volunteers\u000a\u000aUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\u000awill be renamed.\u000a\u000aCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\u000aone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\u000a(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\u000apermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\u000aLiterary Archive Foundation\u000a\u000aProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\u000aspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\u000aincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\u000afreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\u000aarray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\u000a($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\u000astatus with the IRS.\u000a\u000aThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\u000acharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\u000aStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\u000aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\u000awith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\u000awhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\u000aSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\u000aparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\u000a\u000aWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\u000ahave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\u000aagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\u000aapproach us with offers to donate.\u000a\u000aInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\u000aany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\u000aoutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\u000a\u000aPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\u000amethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\u000aways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\u000aTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\u000a\u000a\u000aSection 5.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\u000aconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\u000awith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\u000aGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\u000a\u000a\u000aProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\u000aeditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\u000aunless a copyright notice is included.
