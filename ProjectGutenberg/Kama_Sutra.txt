Everywhere the subject is dealt\u000awith differently, and from various points of view. In the present\u000apublication it is proposed to give a complete translation of what is\u000aconsidered the standard work on love in Sanscrit literature, and which\u000ais called the 'Vatsyayana Kama Sutra,' or Aphorisms on Love, by\u000aVatsyayana.\u000a\u000aWhile the introduction will bear with the evidence concerning the date\u000aof the writing, and the commentaries written upon it, the chapters\u000afollowing the introduction will give a translation of the work itself.\u000aIt is, however, advisable to furnish here a brief analysis of works of\u000athe same nature, prepared by authors who lived and wrote years after\u000aVatsya had passed away, but who still considered him as a great\u000aauthority, and always quoted him as the chief guide to Hindoo erotic\u000aliterature.\u000a\u000aBesides the treatise of Vatsyayana the following works on the same\u000asubject are procurable in India:--\u000a\u000a     1. The Ratirahasya, or secrets of love.\u000a\u000a     2. The Panchasakya, or the five arrows.\u000a\u000a     3. The Smara Pradipa, or the light of love.\u000a\u000a     4. The Ratimanjari, or the garland of love.\u000a\u000a     5. The Rasmanjari, or the sprout of love.\u000a\u000a     6. The Anunga Runga, or the stage of love; also called\u000a          Kamaledhiplava, or a boat in the ocean of love.\u000a\u000aThe author of the 'Secrets of Love' (No. 1) was a poet named Kukkoka. He\u000acomposed his work to please one Venudutta, who was perhaps a king. When\u000awriting his own name at the end of each chapter he calls himself "Siddha\u000apatiya pandita," _i.e._, an ingenious man among learned men. The work\u000awas translated into Hindi years ago, and in this the author's name was\u000awritten as Koka. And as the same name crept into all the translations\u000ainto other languages in India, the book became generally known, and the\u000asubject was popularly called Koka Shastra, or doctrines of Koka, which\u000ais identical with the Kama Shastra, or doctrines of love, and the words\u000aKoka Shastra and Kama Shastra are used indiscriminately.\u000a\u000aThe work contains nearly eight hundred verses, and is divided into ten\u000achapters, which are called Pachivedas. Some of the things treated of in\u000athis work are not to be found in the Vatsyayana, such as the four\u000aclasses of women, viz., the Padmini, Chitrini, Shankini and Hastini, as\u000aalso the enumeration of the days and hours on which the women of the\u000adifferent classes become subject to love. The author adds that he wrote\u000athese things from the opinions of Gonikaputra and Nandikeshwara, both of\u000awhom are mentioned by Vatsyayana, but their works are not now extant. It\u000ais difficult to give any approximate idea as to the year in which the\u000awork was composed. It is only to be presumed that it was written after\u000athat of Vatsyayana, and previous to the other works on this subject that\u000aare still extant. Vatsyayana gives the names of ten authors on the\u000asubject, all of whose works he had consulted, but none of which are\u000aextant, and does not mention this one. This would tend to show that\u000aKukkoka wrote after Vatsya, otherwise Vatsya would assuredly have\u000amentioned him as an author in this branch of literature along with the\u000aothers.\u000a\u000aThe author of the 'Five Arrows' (No. 2 in the list) was one Jyotirisha.\u000aHe is called the chief ornament of poets, the treasure of the sixty-four\u000aarts, and the best teacher of the rules of music. He says that he\u000acomposed the work after reflecting on the aphorisms of love as revealed\u000aby the gods, and studying the opinions of Gonikaputra, Muladeva,\u000aBabhravya, Ramtideva, Nundikeshwara and Kshemandra. It is impossible to\u000asay whether he had perused all the works of these authors, or had only\u000aheard about them; anyhow, none of them appear to be in existence now.\u000aThis work contains nearly six hundred verses, and is divided into five\u000achapters, called Sayakas or Arrows.\u000a\u000aThe author of the 'Light of Love' (No. 3) was the poet Gunakara, the son\u000aof Vechapati. The work contains four hundred verses, and gives only a\u000ashort account of the doctrines of love, dealing more with other\u000amatters.\u000a\u000a'The Garland of Love' (No. 4) is the work of the famous poet Jayadeva,\u000awho said about himself that he is a writer on all subjects. This\u000atreatise is, however, very short, containing only one hundred and\u000atwenty-five verses.\u000a\u000aThe author of the 'Sprout of Love' (No. 5) was a poet called Bhanudatta.\u000aIt appears from the last verse of the manuscript that he was a resident\u000aof the province of Tirhoot, the son of a Brahman named Ganeshwar, who\u000awas also a poet. The work, written in Sanscrit, gives the descriptions\u000aof different classes of men and women, their classes being made out from\u000atheir age, description, conduct, etc. It contains three chapters, and\u000aits date is not known, and cannot be ascertained.\u000a\u000a'The Stage of Love' (No. 6) was composed by the poet Kullianmull, for\u000athe amusement of Ladkhan, the son of Ahmed Lodi, the same Ladkhan being\u000ain some places spoken of as Ladana Mull, and in others as Ladanaballa.\u000aHe is supposed to have been a relation or connection of the house of\u000aLodi, which reigned in Hindostan from A.D. 1450-1526. The work would,\u000atherefore, have been written in the fifteenth or sixteenth century. It\u000acontains ten chapters, and has been translated into English, but only\u000asix copies were printed for private circulation. This is supposed to be\u000athe latest of the Sanscrit works on the subject, and the ideas in it\u000awere evidently taken from previous writings of the same nature.\u000a\u000aThe contents of these works are in themselves a literary curiosity.\u000aThere are to be found both in Sanscrit poetry and in the Sanscrit drama\u000aa certain amount of poetical sentiment and romance, which have, in every\u000acountry and in every language, thrown an immortal halo round the\u000asubject. But here it is treated in a plain, simple, matter of fact sort\u000aof way. Men and women are divided into classes and divisions in the same\u000away that Buffon and other writers on natural history have classified and\u000adivided the animal world. As Venus was represented by the Greeks to\u000astand forth as the type of the beauty of woman, so the Hindoos describe\u000athe Padmini or Lotus woman as the type of most perfect feminine\u000aexcellence, as follows:\u000a\u000aShe in whom the following signs and symptoms appear is called a Padmini.\u000aHer face is pleasing as the full moon; her body, well clothed with\u000aflesh, is soft as the Shiras or mustard flower, her skin is fine,\u000atender and fair as the yellow lotus, never dark coloured. Her eyes are\u000abright and beautiful as the orbs of the fawn, well cut, and with reddish\u000acorners. Her bosom is hard, full and high; she has a good neck; her nose\u000ais straight and lovely, and three folds or wrinkles cross her\u000amiddle--about the umbilical region. Her yoni resembles the opening lotus\u000abud, and her love seed (Kama salila) is perfumed like the lily that has\u000anewly burst. She walks with swan-like gait, and her voice is low and\u000amusical as the note of the Kokila bird, she delights in white raiments,\u000ain fine jewels, and in rich dresses. She eats little, sleeps lightly,\u000aand being as respectful and religious as she is clever and courteous,\u000ashe is ever anxious to worship the gods, and to enjoy the conversation\u000aof Brahmans. Such, then, is the Padmini or Lotus woman.\u000a\u000aDetailed descriptions then follow of the Chitrini or Art woman; the\u000aShankhini or Conch woman, and the Hastini or Elephant woman, their days\u000aof enjoyment, their various seats of passion, the manner in which they\u000ashould be manipulated and treated in sexual intercourse, along with the\u000acharacteristics of the men and women of the various countries in\u000aHindostan. The details are so numerous, and the subjects so seriously\u000adealt with, and at such length, that neither time nor space will permit\u000aof their being given here.\u000a\u000aOne work in the English language is somewhat similar to these works of\u000athe Hindoos. It is called 'Kalogynomia: or the Laws of Female Beauty,'\u000abeing the elementary principles of that science, by T. Bell, M.D., with\u000atwenty-four plates, and printed in London in 1821. It treats of Beauty,\u000aof Love, of Sexual Intercourse, of the Laws regulating that Intercourse,\u000aof Monogamy and Polygamy, of Prostitution, of Infidelity, ending with a\u000a_catalogue raisonnée_ of the defects of female beauty.\u000a\u000aOther works in English also enter into great details of private and\u000adomestic life. 'The Elements of Social Science, or Physical, Sexual and\u000aNatural Religion,' by a Doctor of Medicine, London, 1880, and 'Every\u000aWoman's Book,' by Dr. Waters, 1826. To persons interested in the above\u000asubjects these works will be found to contain such details as have been\u000aseldom before published, and which ought to be thoroughly understood by\u000aall philanthropists and benefactors of society.\u000a\u000aAfter a perusal of the Hindoo work, and of the English books above\u000amentioned, the reader will understand the subject, at all events from a\u000amaterialistic, realistic and practical point of view. If all science is\u000afounded more or less on a stratum of facts, there can be no harm in\u000amaking known to mankind generally certain matters intimately connected\u000awith their private, domestic, and social life.\u000a\u000aAlas! complete ignorance of them has unfortunately wrecked many a man\u000aand many a woman, while a little knowledge of a subject generally\u000aignored by the masses would have enabled numbers of people to have\u000aunderstood many things which they believed to be quite incomprehensible,\u000aor which were not thought worthy of their consideration.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aINTRODUCTION.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt may be interesting to some persons to learn how it came about that\u000aVatsyayana was first brought to light and translated into the English\u000alanguage. It happened thus. While translating with the pundits the\u000a'Anunga runga, or the stage of love,' reference was frequently found to\u000abe made to one Vatsya. The sage Vatsya was of this opinion, or of that\u000aopinion. The sage Vatsya said this, and so on. Naturally questions were\u000aasked who the sage was, and the pundits replied that Vatsya was the\u000aauthor of the standard work on love in Sanscrit literature, that no\u000aSanscrit library was complete without his work, and that it was most\u000adifficult now to obtain in its entire state. The copy of the manuscript\u000aobtained in Bombay was defective, and so the pundits wrote to Benares,\u000aCalcutta and Jeypoor for copies of the manuscript from Sanscrit\u000alibraries in those places. Copies having been obtained, they were then\u000acompared with each other, and with the aid of a Commentary called\u000a'Jayamangla' a revised copy of the entire manuscript was prepared, and\u000afrom this copy the English translation was made. The following is the\u000acertificate of the chief pundit:--\u000a\u000a"The accompanying manuscript is corrected by me after comparing four\u000adifferent copies of the work. I had the assistance of a Commentary\u000acalled 'Jayamangla' for correcting the portion in the first five parts,\u000abut found great difficulty in correcting the remaining portion, because,\u000awith the exception of one copy thereof which was tolerably correct, all\u000athe other copies I had were far too incorrect. However, I took that\u000aportion as correct in which the majority of the copies agreed with each\u000aother."\u000a\u000aThe 'Aphorisms on Love,' by Vatsyayana, contains about one thousand two\u000ahundred and fifty slokas or verses, and are divided into parts, parts\u000ainto chapters, and chapters into paragraphs. The whole consists of\u000aseven parts, thirty-six chapters, and sixty-four paragraphs. Hardly\u000aanything is known about the author. His real name is supposed to be\u000aMallinaga or Mrillana, Vatsyayana being his family name. At the close of\u000athe work this is what he writes about himself:\u000a\u000a"After reading and considering the works of Babhravya and other ancient\u000aauthors, and thinking over the meaning of the rules given by them, this\u000atreatise was composed, according to the precepts of the Holy Writ, for\u000athe benefit of the world, by Vatsyayana, while leading the life of a\u000areligious student at Benares, and wholly engaged in the contemplation of\u000athe Deity. This work is not to be used merely as an instrument for\u000asatisfying our desires. A person acquainted with the true principles of\u000athis science, who preserves his Dharma (virtue or religious merit), his\u000aArtha (worldly wealth) and his Kama (pleasure or sensual gratification),\u000aand who has regard to the customs of the people, is sure to obtain the\u000amastery over his senses. In short, an intelligent and knowing person,\u000aattending to Dharma and Artha and also to Kama, without becoming the\u000aslave of his passions, will obtain success in everything that he may\u000ado."\u000a\u000aIt is impossible to fix the exact date either of the life of Vatsyayana\u000aor of his work. It is supposed that he must have lived between the first\u000aand the sixth centuries of the Christian era, on the following\u000agrounds:--He mentions that Satkarni Srtvahan, a king of Kuntal, killed\u000aMalayevati his wife with an instrument called kartari by striking her in\u000athe passion of love, and Vatsya quotes this case to warn people of the\u000adanger arising from some old customs of striking women when under the\u000ainfluence of this passion. Now this king of Kuntal is believed to have\u000alived and reigned during the first century A.C., and consequently Vatsya\u000amust have lived after him. On the other hand, Virahamihira, in the\u000aeighteenth chapter of his 'Brihatsanhita,' treats of the science of\u000alove, and appears to have borrowed largely from Vatsyayana on the\u000asubject. Now Virahamihira is said to have lived during the sixth century\u000aA.D., and as Vatsya must have written his works previously, therefore\u000anot earlier than the first century, A.C., and not later than the sixth\u000acentury A.D., must be considered as the approximate date of his\u000aexistence.\u000a\u000aOn the text of the 'Aphorisms on Love,' by Vatsyayana, only two\u000acommentaries have been found. One called 'Jayamangla' or 'Sutrabashya,'\u000aand the other 'Sutra vritti.' The date of the 'Jayamangla' is fixed\u000abetween the tenth and thirteenth centuries A.D., because while treating\u000aof the sixty-four arts an example is taken from the 'Kávyaprakásha,'\u000awhich was written about the tenth century A.D. Again, the copy of the\u000acommentary procured was evidently a transcript of a manuscript which\u000aonce had a place in the library of a Chaulukyan king named Vishaladeva,\u000aa fact elicited from the following sentence at the end of it:--\u000a\u000a"Here ends the part relating to the art of love in the commentary on the\u000a'Vatsyayana Kama Sutra,' a copy from the library of the king of kings,\u000aVishaladeva, who was a powerful hero, as it were a second Arjuna, and\u000ahead jewel of the Chaulukya family."\u000a\u000aNow it is well known that this king ruled in Guzerat from 1244 to 1262\u000aA.D., and founded a city called Visalnagur. The date, therefore, of the\u000acommentary is taken to be not earlier than the tenth and not later than\u000athe thirteenth century. The author of it is supposed to be one\u000aYashodhara, the name given him by his preceptor being Indrapada. He\u000aseems to have written it during the time of affliction caused by his\u000aseparation from a clever and shrewd woman, at least that is what he\u000ahimself says at the end of each chapter. It is presumed that he called\u000ahis work after the name of his absent mistress, or the word may have\u000asome connection with the meaning of her name.\u000a\u000aThis commentary was most useful in explaining the true meaning of\u000aVatsyayana, for the commentator appears to have had a considerable\u000aknowledge of the times of the older author, and gives in some places\u000avery minute information. This cannot be said of the other commentary,\u000acalled "Sutra vritti," which was written about A.D., by Narsing Shastri,\u000aa pupil of a Sarveshwar Shastri; the latter was a descendant of Bhaskur,\u000aand so also was our author, for at the conclusion of every part he calls\u000ahimself Bhaskur Narsing Shastra. He was induced to write the work by\u000aorder of the learned Raja Vrijalala, while he was residing in Benares,\u000abut as to the merits of this commentary it does not deserve much\u000acommendation. In many cases the writer does not appear to have\u000aunderstood the meaning of the original author, and has changed the text\u000ain many places to fit in with his own explanations.\u000a\u000aA complete translation of the original work now follows. It has been\u000aprepared in complete accordance with the text of the manuscript, and is\u000agiven, without further comments, as made from it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPART I.\u000a\u000aTHE VATSYAYANA SUTRA.\u000a\u000aINTRODUCTORY PREFACE.\u000a\u000aSALUTATION TO DHARMA, ARTHA AND KAMA.\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the beginning, the Lord of Beings created men and women, and in the\u000aform of commandments in one hundred thousand chapters laid down rules\u000afor regulating their existence with regard to Dharma,[1] Artha,[2] and\u000aKama.[3] Some of these commandments, namely those which treated of\u000aDharma, were separately written by Swayambhu Manu; those that related to\u000aArtha were compiled by Brihaspati; and those that referred to Kama were\u000aexpounded by Nandi, the follower of Mahadeva, in one thousand chapters.\u000a\u000aNow these 'Kama Sutra' (Aphorisms on Love), written by Nandi in one\u000athousand chapters, were reproduced by Shvetaketu, the son of Uddvalaka,\u000ain an abbreviated form in five hundred chapters, and this work was again\u000asimilarly reproduced in an abridged form, in one hundred and fifty\u000achapters, by Babhravya, an inhabitant of the Punchala (South of Delhi)\u000acountry. These one hundred and fifty chapters were then put together\u000aunder seven heads or parts named severally--\u000a\u000a1st. Sadharana (general topics).\u000a\u000a2nd. Samprayogika (embraces, etc.).\u000a\u000a3rd. Kanya Samprayuktaka (union of males and females).\u000a\u000a4th. Bharyadhikarika (on one's own wife).\u000a\u000a5th. Paradika (on the wives of other people).\u000a\u000a6th. Vaisika (on courtesans).\u000a\u000a7th. Aupamishadika (on the arts of seduction, tonic medicines, etc.).\u000a\u000aThe sixth part of this last work was separately expounded by Dattaka at\u000athe request of the public women of Pataliputra (Patna), and in the same\u000away Charayana explained the first part of it. The remaining parts, viz.,\u000athe second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh were each separately\u000aexpounded by--\u000a\u000aSuvarnanabha (second part).\u000a\u000aGhotakamukha (third part).\u000a\u000aGonardiya (fourth part).\u000a\u000aGonikaputra (fifth part).\u000a\u000aKuchumara (seventh part), respectively.\u000a\u000aThus the work being written in parts by different authors was almost\u000aunobtainable, and as the parts which were expounded by Dattaka and the\u000aothers treated only of the particular branches of the subject to which\u000aeach part related, and moreover as the original work of Babhravya was\u000adifficult to be mastered on account of its length, Vatsyayana,\u000atherefore, composed his work in a small volume as an abstract of the\u000awhole of the works of the above-named authors.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTES:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 1: Dharma is acquisition of religious merit, and is fully\u000adescribed in Chapter 5, Volume III., of Talboys Wheeler's 'History of\u000aIndia,' and in the edicts of Asoka.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 2: Artha is acquisition of wealth and property, etc.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 3: Kama is love, pleasure and sensual gratification.\u000a\u000aThese three words are retained throughout in their original, as\u000atechnical terms.

He should acquire\u000alearning in his childhood, in his youth and middle age he should attend\u000ato Artha and Kama, and in his old age he should perform Dharma, and thus\u000aseek to gain Moksha, _i.e._, release from further transmigration. Or, on\u000aaccount of the uncertainty of life, he may practise them at times when\u000athey are enjoined to be practised. But one thing is to be noted, he\u000ashould lead the life of a religious student until he finishes his\u000aeducation.\u000a\u000a_Dharma_ is obedience to the command of the Shastra or Holy Writ of the\u000aHindoos to do certain things, such as the performance of sacrifices,\u000awhich are not generally done because they do not belong to this world,\u000aand produce no visible effect; and not to do other things, such as\u000aeating meat, which is often done because it belongs to this world, and\u000ahas visible effects.\u000a\u000aDharma should be learnt from the Shruti (Holy Writ), and from those\u000aconversant with it.\u000a\u000a_Artha_ is the acquisition of arts, land, gold, cattle, wealth,\u000aequipages and friends. It is, further, the protection of what is\u000aacquired, and the increase of what is protected.\u000a\u000aArtha should be learnt from the king's officers, and from merchants who\u000amay be versed in the ways of commerce.\u000a\u000a_Kama_ is the enjoyment of appropriate objects by the five senses of\u000ahearing, feeling, seeing, tasting, and smelling, assisted by the mind\u000atogether with the soul. The ingredient in this is a peculiar contact\u000abetween the organ of sense and its object, and the consciousness of\u000apleasure which arises from that contact is called Kama.\u000a\u000aKama is to be learnt from the Kama Sutra (aphorisms on love) and from\u000athe practice of citizens.\u000a\u000aWhen all the three, viz., Dharma, Artha, and Kama come together, the\u000aformer is better than the one which follows it, _i.e._, Dharma is better\u000athan Artha, and Artha is better than Kama. But Artha should be always\u000afirst practised by the king, for the livelihood of men is to be obtained\u000afrom it only. Again, Kama being the occupation of public women, they\u000ashould prefer it to the other two, and these are exceptions to the\u000ageneral rule.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Objection 1._\u000a\u000aSome learned men say that as Dharma is connected with things not\u000abelonging to this world, it is appropriately treated of in a book; and\u000aso also is Artha, because it is practised only by the application of\u000aproper means, and a knowledge of those means can only be obtained by\u000astudy and from books. But Kama being a thing which is practised even by\u000athe brute creation, and which is to be found everywhere, does not want\u000aany work on the subject.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Answer._\u000a\u000aThis is not so. Sexual intercourse being a thing dependent on man and\u000awoman requires the application of proper means by them, and those means\u000aare to be learnt from the Kama Shastra. The non-application of proper\u000ameans, which we see in the brute creation, is caused by their being\u000aunrestrained, and by the females among them only being fit for sexual\u000aintercourse at certain seasons and no more, and by their intercourse not\u000abeing preceded by thought of any kind.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Objection 2._\u000a\u000aThe Lokayatikas[4] say:--Religious ordinances should not be observed,\u000afor they bear a future fruit, and at the same time it is also doubtful\u000awhether they will bear any fruit at all. What foolish person will give\u000aaway that which is in his own hands into the hands of another?\u000aMoreover, it is better to have a pigeon to-day than a peacock to-morrow;\u000aand a copper coin which we have the certainty of obtaining, is better\u000athan a gold coin, the possession of which is doubtful.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Answer._\u000a\u000aIt is not so. 1st. Holy Writ, which ordains the practice of Dharma, does\u000anot admit of a doubt.\u000a\u000a2nd. Sacrifices such as those made for the destruction of enemies, or\u000afor the fall of rain, are seen to bear fruit.\u000a\u000a3rd. The sun, moon, stars, planets and other heavenly bodies appear to\u000awork intentionally for the good of the world.\u000a\u000a4th. The existence of this world is effected by the observance of the\u000arules respecting the four classes[5] of men and their four stages of\u000alife.\u000a\u000a5th. We see that seed is thrown into the ground with the hope of future\u000acrops.\u000a\u000aVatsyayana is therefore of opinion that the ordinances of religion must\u000abe obeyed.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Objection 3._\u000a\u000aThose who believe that destiny is the prime mover of all things say:--We\u000ashould not exert ourselves to acquire wealth, for sometimes it is not\u000aacquired although we strive to get it, while at other times it comes to\u000aus of itself without any exertion on our part. Everything is therefore\u000ain the power of destiny, who is the lord of gain and loss, of success\u000aand defeat, of pleasure and pain. Thus we see the Bali[6] was raised to\u000athe throne of Indra by destiny, and was also put down by the same power,\u000aand it is destiny only that can re-instate him.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Answer._\u000a\u000aIt is not right to say so. As the acquisition of every object\u000apre-supposes at all events some exertion on the part of man, the\u000aapplication of proper means may be said to be the cause of gaining all\u000aour ends, and this application of proper means being thus necessary\u000a(even where a thing is destined to happen), it follows that a person who\u000adoes nothing will enjoy no happiness.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Objection 4._\u000a\u000aThose who are inclined to think that Artha is the chief object to be\u000aobtained argue thus. Pleasures should not be sought for, because they\u000aare obstacles to the practice of Dharma and Artha, which are both\u000asuperior to them, and are also disliked by meritorious persons.\u000aPleasures also bring a man into distress, and into contact with low\u000apersons; they cause him to commit unrighteous deeds, and produce\u000aimpurity in him; they make him regardless of the future, and encourage\u000acarelessness and levity. And lastly, they cause him to be disbelieved by\u000aall, received by none, and despised by everybody, including himself. It\u000ais notorious, moreover, that many men who have given themselves up to\u000apleasure alone, have been ruined along with their families and\u000arelations. Thus, King Dandakya,[7] of the Bhoja dynasty, carried off a\u000aBrahman's daughter with evil intent, and was eventually ruined and lost\u000ahis kingdom. Indra, too, having violated the chastity of Ahalya,[8] was\u000amade to suffer for it. In a like manner the mighty Kichaka,[9] who tried\u000ato seduce Draupadi, and Ravana,[10] who attempted to gain over Sita, were\u000apunished for their crimes. These and many others fell by reason of their\u000apleasures.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Answer._\u000a\u000aThis objection cannot be sustained, for pleasures, being as necessary\u000afor the existence and well being of the body as food, are consequently\u000aequally required. They are, moreover, the results of Dharma and Artha.\u000aPleasures are, therefore, to be followed with moderation and caution. No\u000aone refrains from cooking food because there are beggars to ask for it,\u000aor from sowing seed because there are deer to destroy the corn when it\u000ais grown up.\u000a\u000aThus a man practising Dharma, Artha and Kama enjoys happiness both in\u000athis world and in the world to come. The good perform those actions in\u000awhich there is no fear as to what is to result from them in the next\u000aworld, and in which there is no danger to their welfare. Any action\u000awhich conduces to the practice of Dharma, Artha and Kama together, or of\u000aany two, or even one of them, should be performed, but an action which\u000aconduces to the practice of one of them at the expense of the remaining\u000atwo should not be performed.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTES:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 4: These were certainly materialists who seemed to think that\u000aa bird in the hand was worth two in the bush.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 5: Among the Hindoos the four classes of men are the Brahmans\u000aor priestly class, the Kshutrya or warlike class, the Vaishya or\u000aagricultural and mercantile class, and the Shoodra or menial class.

Kichaka was killed by Bhima,\u000awho assumed the disguise of Draupadi. For this story the Mahabarata\u000ashould be referred to.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 10: The story of Ravana is told in the Ramayana, which with the\u000aMahabarata form the two great epic poems of the Hindoos; the latter was\u000awritten by Vyasa, and the former by Valmiki.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER III.\u000a\u000aON THE ARTS AND SCIENCES TO BE STUDIED.\u000a\u000a\u000aMan should study the Kama Sutra and the arts and sciences subordinate\u000athereto, in addition to the study of the arts and sciences contained in\u000aDharma and Artha. Even young maids should study this Kama Sutra along\u000awith its arts and sciences before marriage, and after it they should\u000acontinue to do so with the consent of their husbands.\u000a\u000aHere some learned men object, and say that females, not being allowed to\u000astudy any science, should not study the Kama Sutra.\u000a\u000aBut Vatsyayana is of opinion that this objection does not hold good, for\u000awomen already know the practice of Kama Sutra, and that practice is\u000aderived from the Kama Shastra, or the science of Kama itself. Moreover,\u000ait is not only in this but in many other cases that though the practice\u000aof a science is known to all, only a few persons are acquainted with the\u000arules and laws on which the science is based. Thus the Yadnikas or\u000asacrificers, though ignorant of grammar, make use of appropriate words\u000awhen addressing the different Deities, and do not know how these words\u000aare framed. Again, persons do the duties required of them on auspicious\u000adays, which are fixed by astrology, though they are not acquainted with\u000athe science of astrology. In a like manner riders of horses and\u000aelephants train these animals without knowing the science of training\u000aanimals, but from practice only. And similarly the people of the most\u000adistant provinces obey the laws of the kingdom from practice, and\u000abecause there is a king over them, and without further reason.[11] And\u000afrom experience we find that some women, such as daughters of princes\u000aand their ministers, and public women, are actually versed in the Kama\u000aShastra.\u000a\u000aA female, therefore, should learn the Kama Shastra, or at least a part\u000aof it, by studying its practice from some confidential friend. She\u000ashould study alone in private the sixty-four practices that form a part\u000aof the Kama Shastra. Her teacher should be one of the following persons,\u000aviz., the daughter of a nurse brought up with her and already\u000amarried,[12] or a female friend who can be trusted in everything, or the\u000asister of her mother (_i.e._, her aunt), or an old female servant, or a\u000afemale beggar who may have formerly lived in the family, or her own\u000asister, who can always be trusted.\u000a\u000aThe following are the arts to be studied, together with the Kama\u000aSutra:--\u000a\u000a1. Singing.\u000a\u000a2. Playing on musical instruments.\u000a\u000a3. Dancing.\u000a\u000a4. Union of dancing, singing, and playing instrumental music.\u000a\u000a5. Writing and drawing.\u000a\u000a6. Tattooing.\u000a\u000a7. Arraying and adorning an idol with rice and flowers.\u000a\u000a8. Spreading and arraying beds or couches of flowers, or flowers upon\u000athe ground.\u000a\u000a9. Colouring the teeth, garments, hair, nails, and bodies, _i.e._,\u000astaining, dyeing, colouring and painting the same.\u000a\u000a10. Fixing stained glass into a floor.\u000a\u000a11. The art of making beds, and spreading out carpets and cushions for\u000areclining.\u000a\u000a12. Playing on musical glasses filled with water.\u000a\u000a13. Storing and accumulating water in aqueducts, cisterns and\u000areservoirs.\u000a\u000a14. Picture making, trimming and decorating.\u000a\u000a15. Stringing of rosaries, necklaces, garlands and wreaths.\u000a\u000a16. Binding of turbans and chaplets, and making crests and top-knots of\u000aflowers.\u000a\u000a17. Scenic representations. Stage playing.\u000a\u000a18. Art of making ear ornaments.\u000a\u000a19. Art of preparing perfumes and odours.\u000a\u000a20. Proper disposition of jewels and decorations, and adornment in\u000adress.\u000a\u000a21. Magic or sorcery.\u000a\u000a22. Quickness of hand or manual skill.\u000a\u000a23. Culinary art, _i.e._, cooking and cookery.\u000a\u000a24. Making lemonades, sherbets, acidulated drinks, and spirituous\u000aextracts with proper flavour and colour.\u000a\u000a25. Tailor's work and sewing.\u000a\u000a26. Making parrots, flowers, tufts, tassels, bunches, bosses, knobs,\u000a&c., out of yarn or thread.\u000a\u000a27. Solution of riddles, enigmas, covert speeches, verbal puzzles and\u000aenigmatical questions.\u000a\u000a28.

She is, moreover, always respected by\u000athe king, and praised by learned men, and her favour being sought for by\u000aall, she becomes an object of universal regard. The daughter of a king\u000atoo, as well as the daughter of a minister, being learned in the above\u000aarts, can make their husbands favourable to them, even though these may\u000ahave thousands of other wives besides themselves. And in the same\u000amanner, if a wife becomes separated from her husband, and falls into\u000adistress, she can support herself easily, even in a foreign country, by\u000ameans of her knowledge of these arts. Even the bare knowledge of them\u000agives attractiveness to a woman, though the practice of them may be only\u000apossible or otherwise according to the circumstances of each case. A man\u000awho is versed in these arts, who is loquacious and acquainted with the\u000aarts of gallantry, gains very soon the hearts of women, even though he\u000ais only acquainted with them for a short time.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTES:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 11: The author wishes to prove that a great many things are\u000adone by people from practice and custom, without their being acquainted\u000awith the reason of things, or the laws on which they are based, and this\u000ais perfectly true.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 12: The proviso of being married applies to all the teachers.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER IV.\u000a\u000aTHE LIFE OF A CITIZEN.[13]\u000a\u000a\u000aHaving thus acquired learning, a man, with the wealth that he may have\u000agained by gift, conquest, purchase, deposit,[14] or inheritance from his\u000aancestors, should become a householder, and pass the life of a citizen.\u000aHe should take a house in a city, or large village, or in the vicinity\u000aof good men, or in a place which is the resort of many persons. This\u000aabode should be situated near some water, and divided into different\u000acompartments for different purposes. It should be surrounded by a\u000agarden, and also contain two rooms, an outer and an inner one. The inner\u000aroom should be occupied by the females, while the outer room, balmy with\u000arich perfumes, should contain a bed, soft, agreeable to the sight\u000acovered with a clean white cloth, low in the middle part, having\u000agarlands and bunches of flowers[15] upon it, and a canopy above it, and\u000atwo pillows, one at the top, another at the bottom. There should be also\u000aa sort of couch besides, and at the head of this a sort of stool, on\u000awhich should be placed the fragrant ointments for the night, as well as\u000aflowers, pots containing collyrium and other fragrant substances, things\u000aused for perfuming the mouth, and the bark of the common citron tree.\u000aNear the couch, on the ground, there should be a pot for spitting, a box\u000acontaining ornaments, and also a lute hanging from a peg made of the\u000atooth of an elephant, a board for drawing, a pot containing perfume,\u000asome books, and some garlands of the yellow amaranth flowers. Not far\u000afrom the couch, and on the ground, there should be a round seat, a toy\u000acart, and a board for playing with dice; outside the outer room\u000athere should be cages of birds,[16] and a separate place for spinning,\u000acarving, and such like diversions. In the garden there should be a\u000awhirling swing and a common swing, as also a bower of creepers covered\u000awith flowers, in which a raised parterre should be made for sitting.\u000a\u000aNow the householder having got up in the morning and performed his\u000anecessary duties,[17] should wash his teeth, apply a limited quantity of\u000aointments and perfumes to his body, put some ornaments on his person and\u000acollyrium on his eyelids and below his eyes, colour his lips with\u000aalacktaka,[18] and look at himself in the glass. Having then eaten betel\u000aleaves, with other things that give fragrance to the mouth, he should\u000aperform his usual business. He should bathe daily, anoint his body with\u000aoil every other day, apply a lathering[19] substance to his body every\u000athree days, get his head (including face) shaved every four days, and\u000athe other parts of his body every five or ten days.[20] All these things\u000ashould be done without fail, and the sweat of the armpits should also be\u000aremoved. Meals should be taken in the forenoon, in the afternoon, and\u000aagain at night, according to Charayana. After breakfast, parrots and\u000aother birds should be taught to speak, and the fighting of cocks,\u000aquails, and rams should follow. A limited time should be devoted to\u000adiversions with Pithamardas, Vitas, and Vidushakas,[21] and then should\u000abe taken the midday sleep.[22] After this the householder, having put on\u000ahis clothes and ornaments, should, during the afternoon, converse with\u000ahis friends. In the evening there should be singing, and after that the\u000ahouseholder, along with his friend, should await in his room, previously\u000adecorated and perfumed, the arrival of the woman that may be attached to\u000ahim, or he may send a female messenger for her, or go for her himself.\u000aAfter her arrival at his house, he and his friend should welcome her,\u000aand entertain her with a loving and agreeable conversation. Thus end the\u000aduties of the day.\u000a\u000aThe following are the things to be done occasionally as diversions or\u000aamusements.\u000a\u000a1. Holding festivals[23] in honour of different Deities.\u000a\u000a2. Social gatherings of both sexes.\u000a\u000a3. Drinking parties.\u000a\u000a4. Picnics.\u000a\u000a5. Other social diversions.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Festivals._\u000a\u000aOn some particular auspicious day, an assembly of citizens should be\u000aconvened in the temple of Saraswati.[24] There the skill of singers, and\u000aof others who may have come recently to the town, should be tested, and\u000aon the following day they should always be given some rewards. After\u000athat they may either be retained or dismissed, according as their\u000aperformances are liked or not by the assembly. The members of the\u000aassembly should act in concert, both in times of distress as well as in\u000atimes of prosperity, and it is also the duty of these citizens to show\u000ahospitality to strangers who may have come to the assembly. What is said\u000aabove should be understood to apply to all the other festivals which may\u000abe held in honour of the different Deities, according to the present\u000arules.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Social Gatherings._\u000a\u000aWhen men of the same age, disposition and talents, fond of the same\u000adiversions and with the same degree of education, sit together in\u000acompany with public women,[25] or in an assembly of citizens, or at the\u000aabode of one among themselves, and engage in agreeable discourse with\u000aeach other, such is called a sitting in company or a social gathering.\u000aThe subjects of discourse are to be the completion of verses half\u000acomposed by others, and the testing the knowledge of one another in the\u000avarious arts. The women who may be the most beautiful, who may like the\u000asame things that the men like, and who may have power to attract the\u000aminds of others, are here done homage to.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Drinking Parties._\u000a\u000aMen and women should drink in one another's houses. And here the men\u000ashould cause the public women to drink, and should then drink\u000athemselves, liquors such as the Madhu, Aireya, Sara, and Asawa, which\u000aare of bitter and sour taste; also drinks concocted from the barks of\u000avarious trees, wild fruits and leaves.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Going to Gardens or Picnics._\u000a\u000aIn the forenoon, men, having dressed themselves should go to gardens on\u000ahorseback, accompanied by public women and followed by servants. And\u000ahaving done there all the duties of the day, and passed the time in\u000avarious agreeable diversions, such as the fighting of quails, cocks and\u000arams, and other spectacles, they should return home in the afternoon in\u000athe same manner, bringing with them bunches of flowers, &c.\u000a\u000aThe same also applies to bathing in summer in water from which wicked or\u000adangerous animals have previously been taken out, and which has been\u000abuilt in on all sides.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Other Social Diversions._\u000a\u000aSpending nights playing with dice. Going out on moonlight nights.\u000aKeeping the festive day in honour of spring. Plucking the sprouts and\u000afruits of the mangoe trees. Eating the fibres of lotuses. Eating the\u000atender ears of corn. Picnicing in the forests when the trees get their\u000anew foliage. The Udakakashvedika or sporting in the water. Decorating\u000aeach other with the flowers of some trees. Pelting each other with the\u000aflowers of the Kadamba tree, and many other sports which may either be\u000aknown to the whole country, or may be peculiar to particular parts of\u000ait. These and similar other amusements should always be carried on by\u000acitizens.\u000a\u000aThe above amusements should be followed by a person who diverts himself\u000aalone in company with a courtesan, as well as by a courtesan who can do\u000athe same in company with her maid servants or with citizens.\u000a\u000aA Pithamarda[26] is a man without wealth, alone in the world, whose only\u000aproperty consists of his Mallika,[27] some lathering, substance and a\u000ared cloth, who comes from a good country, and who is skilled in all the\u000aarts; and by teaching these arts is received in the company of citizens,\u000aand in the abode of public women.\u000a\u000aA Vita[28] is a man who has enjoyed the pleasures of fortune, who is a\u000acompatriot of the citizens with whom he associates, who is possessed of\u000athe qualities of a householder, who has his wife with him, and who is\u000ahonoured in the assembly of citizens, and in the abodes of public women,\u000aand lives on their means and on them.\u000a\u000aA Vidushaka[29] (also called a Vaihasaka, _i.e._, one who provokes\u000alaughter) is a person only acquainted with some of the arts who is a\u000ajester, and who is trusted by all.\u000a\u000aThese persons are employed in matters of quarrels and reconciliations\u000abetween citizens and public women.\u000a\u000aThis remark applies also to female beggars, to women with their heads\u000ashaved, to adulterous women, and to old public women skilled in all the\u000avarious arts.\u000a\u000aThus a citizen living in his town or village, respected by all, should\u000acall on the persons of his own caste who may be worth knowing. He should\u000aconverse in company and gratify his friends by his society, and obliging\u000aothers by his assistance in various matters, he should cause them to\u000aassist one another in the same way.\u000a\u000aThere are some verses on this subject as follows:--\u000a\u000aA citizen discoursing, not entirely in the Sanscrit language,[30] nor\u000awholly in the dialects of the country, on various topics in society,\u000aobtains great respect. The wise should not resort to a society disliked\u000aby the public, governed by no rules, and intent on the destruction of\u000aothers. But a learned man living in a society which acts according to\u000athe wishes of the people, and which has pleasure for its only object is\u000ahighly respected in this world.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTES:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 13: This term would appear to apply generally to an inhabitant\u000aof Hindoostan. It is not meant only for a dweller in a city, like the\u000aLatin Urbanus as opposed to Rusticus.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 14: Gift is peculiar to a Brahman, conquest to a Kshatrya,\u000awhile purchase, deposit, and other means of acquiring wealth belongs to\u000athe Vaishya.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 15: Natural garden flowers.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 16: Such as quails, partridges, parrots, starlings, &c.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 17: The calls of nature always performed by the Hindoos the\u000afirst thing in the morning.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 18: A colour made from lac.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 19: This would act instead of soap, which was not introduced\u000auntil the rule of the Mahomedans.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 20: Ten days are allowed when the hair is taken out with a pair\u000aof pincers.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 21: These are characters generally introduced in the Hindoo\u000adrama; their characteristics will be explained further on.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 22: Noonday sleep is only allowed in summer, when the nights\u000aare short.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 23: These are very common in all parts of India.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 24: In the 'Asiatic Miscellany,' and in Sir W. Jones's works,\u000awill be found a spirited hymn addressed to this goddess, who is adored\u000aas the patroness of the fine arts, especially of music and rhetoric, as\u000athe inventress of the Sanscrit language, &c., &c. She is the goddess of\u000aharmony, eloquence, and language, and is somewhat analogous to Minerva.\u000aFor further information about her, see Edward Moor's 'Hindoo Pantheon.']\u000a\u000a[Footnote 25: The public women, or courtesans (Vesya), of the early\u000aHindoos have often been compared with the Hetera of the Greeks. The\u000asubject is dealt with at some length in H. H. Wilson's 'Select Specimens\u000aof the Theatre of the Hindoos,' in two volumes, Trubner & Co., 1871. It\u000amay be fairly considered that the courtesan was one of the elements, and\u000aan important element too, of early Hindoo society, and that her\u000aeducation and intellect were both superior to that of the women of the\u000ahousehold. Wilson says, "By the Vesya or courtesan, however, we are not\u000ato understand a female who has disregarded the obligation of law or the\u000aprecepts of virtue, but a character reared by a state of manners\u000aunfriendly to the admission of wedded females into society, and opening\u000ait only at the expense of reputation to women who were trained for\u000aassociation with men by personal and mental acquirements to which the\u000amatron was a stranger."]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 26: According to this description a Pithamarda would be a sort\u000aof professor of all the arts, and as such received as the friend and\u000aconfidant of the citizens.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 27: A seat in the form of the letter T.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 28: The Vita is supposed to represent somewhat the character\u000aof the Parasite of the Greek comedy. It is possible that he was retained\u000aabout the person of the wealthy and dissipated as a kind of private\u000ainstructor, as well as an entertaining companion.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 29: Vidushaka is evidently the buffoon and jester. Wilson says\u000aof him that he is the humble companion, not the servant, of a prince or\u000aman of rank, and it is a curious peculiarity that he is always a\u000aBrahman. He bears more affinity to Sancho Panza, perhaps, than any other\u000acharacter in western fiction, imitating him in his combination of\u000ashrewdness and simplicity, his fondness of good living and his love of\u000aease. In the dramas of intrigue he exhibits some of the talents of\u000aMercury, but with less activity and ingenuity, and occasionally suffers\u000aby his interference. According to the technical definition of his\u000aattributes he is to excite mirth by being ridiculous in person, age, and\u000aattire.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 30: This means, it is presumed, that the citizen should be\u000aacquainted with several languages. The middle part of this paragraph\u000amight apply to the Nihilists and Fenians of the day, or to secret\u000asocieties. It was perhaps a reference to the Thugs.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER V.\u000a\u000aABOUT THE KINDS OF WOMEN RESORTED TO BY THE CITIZENS, AND OF FRIENDS AND\u000aMESSENGERS.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen Kama is practised by men of the four castes according to the rules\u000aof the Holy Writ (_i.e._, by lawful marriage) with virgins of their own\u000acaste, it then becomes a means of acquiring lawful progeny and good\u000afame, and it is not also opposed to the customs of the world. On the\u000acontrary the practice of Kama with women of the higher castes, and with\u000athose previously enjoyed by others, even though they be of the same\u000acaste, is prohibited. But the practice of Kama with women of the lower\u000acastes, with women excommunicated from their own caste, with public\u000awomen, and with women twice married,[31] is neither enjoined nor\u000aprohibited. The object of practising Kama with such women is pleasure\u000aonly.\u000a\u000aNayikas,[32] therefore, are of three kinds, viz., maids, women twice\u000amarried, and public women. Gonikaputra has expressed an opinion that\u000athere is a fourth kind of Nayika, viz., a woman who is resorted to on\u000asome special occasion even though she be previously married to another.\u000aThese special occasions are when a man thinks thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_a_). This woman is self-willed, and has been previously enjoyed\u000a              by many others besides myself. I may, therefore, safely\u000a              resort to her as to a public woman though she belongs to a\u000a              higher caste than mine, and in so doing I shall not be\u000a              violating the ordinances of\u000a              Dharma.\u000a\u000aOr thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_b_). This is a twice-married woman and has been enjoyed by others\u000a              before me, there is, therefore, no objection to my\u000a              resorting to her.\u000a\u000aOr thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_c_). This woman has gained the heart of her great and powerful\u000a              husband, and exercises a mastery over him, who is a friend\u000a              of my enemy; if, therefore, she becomes united with me,\u000a              she will cause her husband to abandon my enemy.\u000a\u000aOr thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_d_). This woman will turn the mind of her husband, who is very\u000a              powerful, in my favour, he being at present disaffected\u000a              towards me, and intent on doing me some harm.\u000a\u000aOr thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_e_). By making this woman my friend I shall gain the object of\u000a              some friend of mine, or shall be able to effect the ruin\u000a              of some enemy, or shall accomplish some other difficult\u000a              purpose.\u000a\u000aOr thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_f_). By being united with this woman, I shall kill her husband,\u000a              and so obtain his vast riches which I covet.\u000a\u000aOr thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_g_). The union of this woman with me is not attended with any\u000a              danger, and will bring me wealth, of which, on account of\u000a              my poverty and inability to support myself, I am very much\u000a              in need. I shall, therefore, obtain her vast riches in\u000a              this way without any difficulty.\u000a\u000aOr thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_h_). This woman loves me ardently, and knows all my weak points,\u000a              if therefore, I am unwilling to be united with her, she\u000a              will make my faults public, and thus tarnish my character\u000a              and reputation. Or she will bring some gross accusation\u000a              against me, of which it may be hard to clear myself, and I\u000a              shall be ruined. Or perhaps she will detach from me her\u000a              husband, who is powerful, and yet under her control, and\u000a              will unite him to my enemy, or will herself join the latter.\u000a\u000aOr thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_i_). The husband of this woman has violated the chastity of my\u000a              wives, I shall therefore return that injury by seducing\u000a              his wives.\u000a\u000aOr thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_j_). By the help of this woman I shall kill an enemy of the king,\u000a              who has taken shelter with her, and whom I am ordered by\u000a              the king to destroy.\u000a\u000aOr thus:\u000a\u000a     (_k_). The woman whom I love is under the control of this woman. I\u000a              shall, through the influence of the latter, be able to get\u000a              at the former.\u000a\u000aOr thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_l_). This woman will bring to me a maid, who possesses wealth and\u000a              beauty, but who is hard to get at, and under the control\u000a              of another.\u000a\u000aOr, lastly, thus:--\u000a\u000a     (_m_). My enemy is a friend of this woman's husband, I shall\u000a              therefore cause her to join him, and will thus create an\u000a              enmity between her husband and him.\u000a\u000aFor these and similar other reasons the wives of other men may be\u000aresorted to, but it must be distinctly understood that is only allowed\u000afor special reasons, and not for mere carnal desire.\u000a\u000aCharayana thinks that under these circumstances there is also a fifth\u000akind of Nayika, viz., a woman who is kept by a minister, and who repairs\u000ato him occasionally; or a widow who accomplishes the purpose of a man\u000awith the person to whom she resorts.\u000a\u000aSuvarnanabha adds that a woman who passes the life of an ascetic and in\u000athe condition of a widow may be considered as a sixth kind of Nayika.\u000a\u000aGhotakamukha says that the daughter of a public woman, and a female\u000aservant, who are still virgins, form a seventh kind of Nayika.\u000a\u000aGonardiya puts forth his doctrine that any woman born of good family,\u000aafter she has come of age, is an eighth kind of Nayika.\u000a\u000aBut these four latter kinds of Nayikas do not differ much from the first\u000afour kinds of them, as there is no separate object in resorting to\u000athem. Therefore Vatsyayana is of opinion that there are only four kinds\u000aof Nayikas, _i.e._, the maid, the twice married woman, the public woman,\u000aand the woman resorted to for a special purpose.\u000a\u000aThe following women are not to be enjoyed:--\u000a\u000aA leper.\u000a\u000aA lunatic.\u000a\u000aA woman turned out of caste.\u000a\u000aA woman who reveals secrets.\u000a\u000aA woman who publicly expresses desire for sexual intercourse.\u000a\u000aA woman who is extremely white.\u000a\u000aA woman who is extremely black.\u000a\u000aA bad-smelling woman.\u000a\u000aA woman who is a near relation.\u000a\u000aA woman who is a female friend.\u000a\u000aA woman who leads the life of an ascetic.\u000a\u000aAnd, lastly, the wife of a relation, of a friend, of a learned Brahman,\u000aand of the king.\u000a\u000aThe followers of Babhravya say that any woman who has been enjoyed by\u000afive men is a fit and proper person to be enjoyed. But Gonikaputra is of\u000aopinion that even when this is the case, the wives of a relation, of a\u000alearned Brahman and of a king should be excepted.\u000a\u000aThe following are the kind of friends:--\u000a\u000aOne who has played with you in the dust, _i.e._, in childhood.\u000a\u000aOne who is bound by an obligation.\u000a\u000aOne who is of the same disposition and fond of the same things.\u000a\u000aOne who is a fellow student.\u000a\u000aOne who is acquainted with your secrets and faults, and whose faults and\u000asecrets are also known to you.\u000a\u000aOne who is a child of your nurse.\u000a\u000aOne who is brought up with you.\u000a\u000aOne who is an hereditary friend.\u000a\u000aThese friends should possess the following qualities:--\u000a\u000aThey should tell the truth.\u000a\u000aThey should not be changed by time.\u000a\u000aThey should be favourable to your designs.\u000a\u000aThey should be firm.\u000a\u000aThey should be free from covetousness.\u000a\u000aThey should not be capable of being gained over by others.\u000a\u000aThey should not reveal your secrets.\u000a\u000aCharayana says that citizens form friendship with washermen, barbers,\u000acowherds, florists, druggists, betel-leaf sellers, tavern keepers,\u000abeggars, Pithamardas, Vitas and Vidushekas, as also with the wives of\u000aall these people.\u000a\u000aA messenger should possess the following qualities:--\u000a\u000aSkilfulness.\u000a\u000aBoldness.\u000a\u000aKnowledge of the intention of men by their outward signs.\u000a\u000aAbsence of confusion, _i.e._, no shyness.\u000a\u000aKnowledge of the exact meaning of what others do or say.\u000a\u000aGood manners.\u000a\u000aKnowledge of appropriate times and places for doing different things.\u000a\u000aIngenuity in business.\u000a\u000aQuick comprehension.\u000a\u000aQuick application of remedies, _i.e._, quick and ready resources.\u000a\u000aAnd this part ends with a verse:--\u000a\u000aThe man who is ingenious and wise, who is accompanied by a friend, and\u000awho knows the intentions of others, as also the proper time and place\u000afor doing everything, can gain over, very easily, even a woman who is\u000avery hard to be obtained.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTES:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 31: This term does not apply to a widow, but to a woman who\u000ahad probably left her husband, and is living with some other person as a\u000amarried woman, maritalement, as they say in France.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 32: Any woman fit to be enjoyed without sin. The object of the\u000aenjoyment of women is twofold, viz., pleasure and progeny. Any woman who\u000acan be enjoyed without sin for the purpose of accomplishing either the\u000aone or the other of these two objects is a Nayika. The fourth kind of\u000aNayika which Vatsya admits further on is neither enjoyed for pleasure or\u000afor progeny, but merely for accomplishing some special purpose in hand.\u000aThe word Nayika is retained as a technical term throughout.]\u000a\u000a=END OF PART I.=\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPART II.\u000a\u000aOF SEXUAL UNION.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER I.\u000a\u000aKINDS OF SEXUAL UNION ACCORDING TO\u000a\u000a     (_a_) DIMENSIONS.\u000a     (_b_) FORCE OF DESIRE OR PASSION.\u000a     (_c_) TIME.\u000a\u000a_Kinds of Union._\u000a\u000aMan is divided into three classes, viz., the hare man, the bull man, and\u000athe horse man, according to the size of his lingam.\u000a\u000aWoman also, according to the depth of her yoni, is either a female deer,\u000aa mare, or a female elephant.\u000a\u000aThere are thus three equal unions between persons of corresponding\u000adimensions, and there are six unequal unions, when the dimensions do not\u000acorrespond, or nine in all, as the following table shows:\u000a\u000a   +--------------------+--------------------+\u000a   |      EQUAL.        |      UNEQUAL.      |\u000a   +--------------------+--------------------+\u000a   |  MEN.  |   WOMEN.  |  MEN.  | WOMEN.    |\u000a   +--------+-----------+--------|-----------+\u000a   |        |           |        |           |\u000a   | Hare.  | Deer.     | Hare.  | Mare.     |\u000a   | Bull.  | Mare.     | Hare.  | Elephant. |\u000a   | Horse. | Elephant. | Bull.  | Deer.     |\u000a   |        |           | Bull.  | Elephant. |\u000a   |        |           | Horse. | Deer.     |\u000a   |        |           | Horse. | Mare.     |\u000a   +--------+-----------+--------+-----------+\u000a\u000aIn these unequal unions, when the male exceeds the female in point of\u000asize, his union with a woman who is immediately next to him in size is\u000acalled high union, and is of two kinds; while his union with the woman\u000amost remote from him in size is called the highest union, and is of one\u000akind only. On the other hand when the female exceeds the male in point\u000aof size, her union with a man immediately next to her in size is called\u000alow union, and is of two kinds; while her union with a man most remote\u000afrom her in size is called the lowest union, and is of one kind only.\u000a\u000aIn other words, the horse and mare, the bull and deer, form the high\u000aunion, while the horse and deer form the highest union. On the female\u000aside, the elephant and bull, the mare and hare, form low unions, while\u000athe elephant and the hare make the lowest unions.\u000a\u000aThere are then, nine kinds of union according to dimensions. Amongst all\u000athese, equal unions are the best, those of a superlative degree, _i.e._,\u000athe highest and the lowest, are the worst, and the rest are middling,\u000aand with them the high[33] are better than the low.\u000a\u000aThere are also nine kinds of union according to the force of passion or\u000acarnal desire, as follows:\u000a\u000a   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\u000a   |    MEN.   |   WOMEN.  |    MEN.   |   WOMEN.  |\u000a   +-----------+-----------+-----------|-----------+\u000a   |           |           |           |           |\u000a   | Small.    | Small.    | Small.    | Middling. |\u000a   | Middling. | Middling. | Small.    | Intense.  |\u000a   | Intense.  | Intense.  | Middling. | Small.    |\u000a   |           |           | Middling. | Intense.  |\u000a   |           |           | Intense.  | Small.    |\u000a   |           |           | Intense.  | Middling. |\u000a   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\u000a\u000aA man is called a man of small passion whose desire at the time of\u000asexual union is not great, whose semen is scanty, and who cannot bear\u000athe warm embraces of the female.\u000a\u000aThose who differ from this temperament are called men of middling\u000apassion, while those of intense passion are full of desire.\u000a\u000aIn the same way, women are supposed to have the three degrees of feeling\u000aas specified above.\u000a\u000aLastly, according to time there are three kinds of men and women, viz.,\u000athe short-timed, the moderate-timed, and the long-timed, and of these as\u000ain the previous statements, there are nine kinds of union.\u000a\u000aBut on this last head there is a difference of opinion about the female,\u000awhich should be stated.\u000a\u000aAuddalika says, "Females do not emit as males do. The males simply\u000aremove their desire, while the females, from their consciousness of\u000adesire, feel a certain kind of pleasure, which gives them satisfaction,\u000abut it is impossible for them to tell you what kind of pleasure they\u000afeel. The fact from which this becomes evident is, that males, when\u000aengaged in coition, cease of themselves after emission, and are\u000asatisfied, but it is not so with females."\u000a\u000aThis opinion is, however, objected to on the grounds that if a male be a\u000along-timed, the female loves him the more, but if he be short-timed, she\u000ais dissatisfied with him. And this circumstance, some say, would prove\u000athat the female emits also.\u000a\u000aBut this opinion does not hold good, for if it takes a long time to\u000aallay a woman's desire, and during this time she is enjoying great\u000apleasure, it is quite natural then that she should wish for its\u000acontinuation. And on this subject there is a verse as follows:\u000a\u000a"By union with men the lust, desire, or passion of women is satisfied,\u000aand the pleasure derived from the consciousness of it is called their\u000asatisfaction."\u000a\u000aThe followers of Babhravya, however, say that the semen of women\u000acontinues to fall from the beginning of the sexual union to its end, and\u000ait is right that it should be so, for if they had no semen there would\u000abe no embryo.\u000a\u000aTo this there is an objection. In the beginning of coition the passion\u000aof the woman is middling, and she cannot bear the vigorous thrusts of\u000aher lover, but by degrees her passion increases until she ceases to\u000athink about her body, and then finally she wishes to stop from further\u000acoition.\u000a\u000aThis objection, however, does not hold good, for even in ordinary things\u000athat revolve with great force, such as a potter's wheel, or a top, we\u000afind that the motion at first is slow, but by degrees it becomes very\u000arapid. In the same way the passion of the woman having gradually\u000aincreased, she has a desire to discontinue coition, when all the semen\u000ahas fallen away. And there is a verse with regard to this as follows:\u000a\u000a"The fall of the semen of the man takes place only at the end of\u000acoition, while the semen of the woman falls continually, and after the\u000asemen of both has all fallen away then they wish for the discontinuance\u000aof coition."[34]\u000a\u000aLastly, Vatsyayana is of opinion that the semen of the female falls in\u000athe same way as that of the male.\u000a\u000aNow some may ask here: If men and women are beings of the same kind, and\u000aare engaged in bringing about the same result, why should they have\u000adifferent works to do.\u000a\u000aVatsya says that this is so, because the ways of working as well as the\u000aconsciousness of pleasure in men and women are different. The difference\u000ain the ways of working, by which men are the actors, and women are the\u000apersons acted upon, is owing to the nature of the male and the female,\u000aotherwise the actor would be sometimes the person acted upon, and vice\u000aversâ. And from this difference in the ways of working follows the\u000adifference in the consciousness of pleasure, for a man thinks, "this\u000awoman is united with me," and a woman thinks, "I am united with this\u000aman."\u000a\u000aIt may be said that if the ways of working in men and women are\u000adifferent, why should not there be a difference, even in the pleasure\u000athey feel, and which is the result of those ways.\u000a\u000aBut this objection is groundless, for the person acting and the person\u000aacted upon being of different kinds, there is a reason for the\u000adifference in their ways of working; but there is no reason for any\u000adifference in the pleasure they feel, because they both naturally derive\u000apleasure from the act they perform.[35]\u000a\u000aOn this again some may say that when different persons are engaged in\u000adoing the same work, we find that they accomplish the same end or\u000apurpose: while, on the contrary, in the case of men and women we find\u000athat each of them accomplishes his or her own end separately, and this\u000ais inconsistent. But this is a mistake, for we find that sometimes two\u000athings are done at the same time, as for instance in the fighting of\u000arams, both the rams receive the shock at the same time on their heads.\u000aAgain, in throwing one wood apple against another, and also in a fight\u000aor struggle of wrestlers. If it be said that in these cases the things\u000aemployed are of the same kind, it is answered that even in the case of\u000amen and women, the nature of the two persons is the same. And as the\u000adifference in their ways of working arises from the difference of their\u000aconformation only, it follows that men experience the same kind of\u000apleasure as women do.\u000a\u000aThere is also a verse on this subject as follows: "Men and women being\u000aof the same nature, feel the same kind of pleasure, and therefore a man\u000ashould marry such a woman as will love him ever afterwards."\u000a\u000aThe pleasure of men and women being thus proved to be of the same kind,\u000ait follows that in regard to time, there are nine kinds of sexual\u000aintercourse, in the same way as there are nine kinds, according to the\u000aforce of passion.\u000a\u000aThere being thus nine kinds of union with regard to dimensions, force of\u000apassion, and time, respectively, by making combinations of them,\u000ainnumerable kinds of union would be produced. Therefore in each\u000aparticular kind of sexual union, men should use such means as they may\u000athink suitable for the occasion.[36]\u000a\u000aAt the first time of sexual union the passion of the male is intense,\u000aand his time is short, but in subsequent unions on the same day the\u000areverse of this is the case. With the female, however, it is the\u000acontrary, for at the first time her passion is weak, and then her time\u000along, but on subsequent occasions on the same day, her passion is\u000aintense and her time short, until her passion is satisfied.\u000a\u000a\u000a_On the different kinds of Love._\u000a\u000aMen learned in the humanities are of opinion that love is of four kinds,\u000aviz.:\u000a\u000a1. Love acquired by continual habit.\u000a\u000a2. Love resulting from the imagination.\u000a\u000a3. Love resulting from belief.\u000a\u000a4. Love resulting from the perception of external objects.\u000a\u000a(1). Love resulting from the constant and continual performance and\u000ahabit, as for instance the love of sexual intercourse, the love of\u000ahunting, the love of drinking, the love of gambling, etc., etc.\u000a\u000a(2). Love which is felt for things to which we are not habituated, and\u000awhich proceeds entirely from ideas, is called love resulting from\u000aimagination, as for instance, that love which some men and women and\u000aeunuchs feel for the Auparishtaka or mouth congress, and that which is\u000afelt by all for such things as embracing, kissing, etc., etc.\u000a\u000a(3). The love which is mutual on both sides, and proved to be true, when\u000aeach looks upon the other as his or her very own, such is called love\u000aresulting from belief by the learned.\u000a\u000a(4). The love resulting from the perception of eternal objects is quite\u000aevident and well-known to the world, because the pleasure which it\u000aaffords is superior to the pleasure of the other kinds of love, which\u000aexists only for its sake.\u000a\u000aWhat has been said in this chapter upon the subject of sexual union is\u000asufficient for the learned; but for the edification of the ignorant, the\u000asame will now be treated of at length and in detail.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTES:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 33: High unions are said to be better than low ones, for in\u000athe former it is possible for the male to satisfy his own passion\u000awithout injuring the female, while in the latter it is difficult for the\u000afemale to be satisfied by any means.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 34: The strength of passion with women varies a great deal,\u000asome being easily satisfied, and others eager and willing to go on for a\u000along time. To satisfy these last thoroughly a man must have recourse to\u000aart. It is certain that a fluid flows from the woman in larger or\u000asmaller quantities, but her satisfaction is not complete until she has\u000aexperienced the "spasme génêsique," as described in a French work\u000arecently published and called "Breviare de l'Amour Experimental par le\u000aDr. Jules Guyot."]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 35: This is a long dissertation very common among Sanscrit\u000aauthors, both when writing and talking socially. They start certain\u000apropositions, and then argue for and against them. What it is presumed\u000athe author means, is, that though both men and women derive pleasure\u000afrom the act of coition, the way it is produced is brought about by\u000adifferent means, each individual performing his own work in the matter,\u000airrespective of the other, and each deriving individually their own\u000aconsciousness of pleasure from the act they perform. There is a\u000adifference in the work that each does, and a difference in the\u000aconsciousness of pleasure that each has, but no difference in the\u000apleasure they feel, for each feels that pleasure to a greater or lesser\u000adegree.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 36: This paragraph should be particularly noted, for it\u000aspecially applies to married men and their wives. So many men utterly\u000aignore the feelings of the women, and never pay the slightest attention\u000ato the passion of the latter. To understand the subject thoroughly, it\u000ais absolutely necessary to study it, and then a person will know that,\u000aas dough is prepared for baking, so must a woman be prepared for sexual\u000aintercourse, if she is to derive satisfaction from it.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER II.\u000a\u000aOF THE EMBRACE.\u000a\u000a\u000aThis part of the Kama Shastra, which treats of sexual union, is also\u000acalled "Sixty-four" (Chatushshashti). Some old authors say that it is\u000acalled so, because it contains sixty-four chapters. Others are of\u000aopinion that the author of this part being a person named Panchala, and\u000athe person who recited the part of the Rig Veda called Dashatapa, which\u000acontains sixty-four verses, being also called Panchala, the name\u000a"sixty-four" has been given to the part of the work in honour of the Rig\u000aVedas. The followers of Babhravya say on the other hand that this part\u000acontains eight subjects, viz., the embrace, kissing, scratching with the\u000anails or fingers, biting, lying down, making various sounds, playing the\u000apart of a man, and the Auparishtaka, or mouth congress. Each of these\u000asubjects being of eight kinds, and eight multiplied by eight being\u000asixty-four, this part is therefore named "sixty-four." But Vatsyayana\u000aaffirms that as this part contains also the following subjects, viz.,\u000astriking, crying, the acts of a man during congress, the various kinds\u000aof congress, and other subjects, the name "sixty-four" is given to it\u000aonly accidentally. As, for instance, we say this tree is "Saptaparna,"\u000aor seven-leaved, this offering of rice is "Panchavarna," or\u000afive-coloured, but the tree has not seven leaves, neither has the rice\u000afive colours.\u000a\u000aHowever the part sixty-four is now treated of, and the embrace, being\u000athe first subject, will now be considered.\u000a\u000aNow the embrace which indicates the mutual love of a man and woman who\u000ahave come together is of four kinds, viz.:\u000a\u000a   Touching.\u000a   Piercing.\u000a   Rubbing.\u000a   Pressing.\u000a\u000aThe action in each case is denoted by the meaning of the word which\u000astands for it.\u000a\u000a(1). When a man under some pretext or other goes in front or alongside\u000aof a woman and touches her body with his own, it is called the "touching\u000aembrace."\u000a\u000a(2). When a woman in a lonely place bends down, as if to pick up\u000asomething, and pierces, as it were, a man sitting or standing, with her\u000abreasts, and the man in return takes hold of them, it is called a\u000a"piercing embrace."\u000a\u000aThe above two kinds of embrace takes place only between persons who do\u000anot, as yet, speak freely with each other.\u000a\u000a(3). When two lovers are walking slowly together, either in the dark, or\u000ain a place of public resort, or in a lonely place, and rub their bodies\u000aagainst each other, it is called a "rubbing embrace."\u000a\u000a(4). When on the above occasion one of them presses the other's body\u000aforcibly against a wall or pillar, it is called a "pressing embrace."\u000a\u000aThese two last embraces are peculiar to those who know the intentions of\u000aeach other.\u000a\u000aAt the time of the meeting the four following kinds of embrace are used,\u000aviz.:\u000a\u000a_Jataveshtitaka_, or the twining of a creeper.\u000a\u000a_Vrikshadhirudhaka_, or climbing a tree.\u000a\u000a_Tila-Tandulaka_, or the mixture of sesamum seed with rice.\u000a\u000a_Kshiraniraka_, or milk and water embrace.\u000a\u000a(1). When a woman, clinging to a man as a creeper twines round a tree,\u000abends his head down to hers with the desire of kissing him and slightly\u000amakes the sound of sut sut, embraces him, and looks lovingly towards\u000ahim, it is called an embrace like the "twining of a creeper."\u000a\u000a(2). When a woman, having placed one of her feet on the foot of her\u000alover, and the other on one of his thighs, passes one of her arms round\u000ahis back, and the other on his shoulders, makes slightly the sounds of\u000asinging and cooing, and wishes, as it were, to climb up him in order to\u000ahave a kiss, it is called an embrace like the "climbing of a tree."\u000a\u000aThese two kinds of embrace take place when the lover is standing.\u000a\u000a(3). When lovers lie on a bed, and embrace each other so closely that\u000athe arms and thighs of the one are encircled by the arms and thighs of\u000athe other, and are, as it were, rubbing up against them, this is called\u000aan embrace like "the mixture of sesamum seed with rice."\u000a\u000a(4). When a man and a woman are very much in love with each other, and\u000anot thinking of any pain or hurt, embrace each other as if they were\u000aentering into each other's bodies, either while the woman is sitting on\u000athe lap of the man or in front of him, or on a bed, then it is called an\u000aembrace like a "mixture of milk and water."\u000a\u000aThese two kinds of embrace take place at the time of sexual union.\u000a\u000aBabhravya has thus related to us the above eight kinds of embraces.\u000a\u000aSuvarnanabha, moreover, gives us four ways of embracing simple members\u000aof the body, which are:\u000a\u000aThe embrace of the thighs.\u000a\u000aThe embrace of the jaghana, _i.e._, the part of the body from the navel\u000adownwards to the thighs.\u000a\u000aThe embrace of the breasts.\u000a\u000aThe embrace of the forehead.\u000a\u000a(1). When one of two lovers presses forcibly one or both of the thighs\u000aof the other between his or her own, it is called the "embrace of\u000athighs."\u000a\u000a(2). When a man presses the jaghana or middle part of the woman's body\u000aagainst his own, and mounts upon her to practise, either scratching with\u000athe nail or finger, or biting, or striking, or kissing, the hair of the\u000awoman being loose and flowing, it is called the "embrace of the\u000ajaghana."\u000a\u000a(3). When a man places his breast between the breasts of a woman, and\u000apresses her with it, it is called the "embrace of the breasts."\u000a\u000a(4). When either of the lovers touches the mouth, the eyes and the\u000aforehead of the other with his or her own, it is called the "embrace of\u000athe forehead."\u000a\u000aSome say that even shampooing is a kind of embrace, because there is a\u000atouching of bodies in it. But Vatsyayana thinks that shampooing is\u000aperformed at a different time, and for a different purpose, and it is\u000aalso of a different character, it cannot be said to be included in the\u000aembrace.\u000a\u000aThere are also some verses on the subject as follows: "The whole subject\u000aof embracing is of such a nature that men who ask questions about it, or\u000awho hear about it, or who talk about it, acquire thereby a desire for\u000aenjoyment. Even those embraces that are not mentioned in the Kama\u000aShastra should be practised at the time of sexual enjoyment, if they are\u000ain any way conducive to the increase of love or passion. The rules of\u000athe Shastra apply so long as the passion of man is middling, but when\u000athe wheel of love is once set in motion, there is then no Shastra and no\u000aorder."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER III.\u000a\u000aON KISSING.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt is said by some that there is no fixed time or order between the\u000aembrace, the kiss, and the pressing or scratching with the nails or\u000afingers, but that all these things should be done generally before\u000asexual union takes place, while striking and making the various sounds\u000agenerally takes place at the time of the union. Vatsyayana, however,\u000athinks that anything may take place at any time, for love does not care\u000afor time or order.\u000a\u000aOn the occasion of the first congress, kissing and the other things\u000amentioned above should be done moderately, they should not be continued\u000afor a long time, and should be done alternately. On subsequent\u000aoccasions, however, the reverse of all this may take place, and\u000amoderation will not be necessary, they may continue for a long time, and\u000afor the purpose of kindling love, they may be all done at the same time.\u000a\u000aThe following are the places for kissing, viz., the forehead, the eyes,\u000athe cheeks, the throat, the bosom, the breasts, the lips, and the\u000ainterior of the mouth. Moreover, the people of the Lat country kiss also\u000aon the following places, viz., the joints of the thighs, the arms, and\u000athe navel. But Vatsyayana thinks that though kissing is practised by\u000athese people in the above places on account of the intensity of their\u000alove, and the customs of their country, it is not fit to be practised by\u000aall.\u000a\u000aNow in a case of a young girl there are three sort of kisses, viz.:\u000a\u000a   The nominal kiss.\u000a   The throbbing kiss.\u000a   The touching kiss.\u000a\u000a(1). When a girl only touches the mouth of her lover with her own, but\u000adoes not herself do anything, it is called the "nominal kiss."\u000a\u000a(2). When a girl, setting aside her bashfulness a little, wishes to\u000atouch the lip that is pressed into her mouth, and with that object\u000amoves her lower lip, but not the upper one, it is called the "throbbing\u000akiss."\u000a\u000a(3). When a girl touches her lover's lip with her tongue, and having\u000ashut her eyes, places her hands on those of her lover, it is called the\u000a"touching kiss."\u000a\u000aOther authors describe four other kinds of kisses, viz.:\u000a\u000a   The straight kiss.\u000a   The bent kiss.\u000a   The turned kiss.\u000a   The pressed kiss.\u000a\u000a(1). When the lips of two lovers are brought into direct contact with\u000aeach other, it is called a "straight kiss."\u000a\u000a(2). When the heads of two lovers are bent towards each other, and when\u000aso bent kissing takes place, it is called a "bent kiss."\u000a\u000a(3). When one of them turns up the face of the other by holding the head\u000aand chin, and then kissing, it is called a "turned kiss."\u000a\u000a(4). Lastly, when the lower lip is pressed with much force, it is called\u000aa "pressed kiss."\u000a\u000aThere is also a fifth kind of kiss called the "greatly pressed kiss,"\u000awhich is effected by taking hold of the lower lip between two fingers,\u000aand then after touching it with the tongue, pressing it with great force\u000awith the lip.\u000a\u000aAs regards kissing, a wager may be laid as to which will get hold of the\u000alips of the other first. If the woman loses, she should pretend to cry,\u000ashould keep her lover off by shaking her hands, and turn away from him\u000aand dispute with him, saying "let another wager be laid." If she loses\u000athis a second time, she should appear doubly distressed, and when her\u000alover is off his guard or asleep, she should get hold of his lower lip,\u000aand hold it in her teeth, so that it should not slip away, and then she\u000ashould laugh, make a loud noise, deride him, dance about, and say\u000awhatever she likes in a joking way, moving her eyebrows, and rolling her\u000aeyes. Such are the wagers and quarrels as far as kissing is concerned,\u000abut the same may be applied with regard to the pressing or scratching\u000awith the nails and fingers, biting and striking. All these, however, are\u000aonly peculiar to men and women of intense passion.\u000a\u000aWhen a man kisses the upper lip of a woman, while she in return kisses\u000ahis lower lip, it is called the "kiss of the upper lip."\u000a\u000aWhen one of them takes both the lips of the other between his or her\u000aown, it is called "a clasping kiss." A woman, however, only takes this\u000akind of kiss from a man who has no moustache. And on the occasion of\u000athis kiss, if one of them touches the teeth, the tongue, and the palate\u000aof the other, with his or her tongue, it is called the "fighting of the\u000atongue." In the same way, the pressing of the teeth of the one against\u000athe mouth of the other is to be practised.\u000a\u000aKissing is of four kinds, viz., moderate, contracted, pressed, and soft,\u000aaccording to the different parts of the body which are kissed, for\u000adifferent kinds of kisses are appropriate for different parts of the\u000abody.\u000a\u000aWhen a woman looks at the face of her lover while he is asleep, and\u000akisses it to show her intention or desire, it is called a "kiss that\u000akindles love."\u000a\u000aWhen a woman kisses her lover while he is engaged in business, or while\u000ahe is quarrelling with her, or while he is looking at something else, so\u000athat his mind may be turned away, it is called a "kiss that turns away."\u000a\u000aWhen a lover coming home late at night kisses his beloved, who is asleep\u000aor in bed, in order to show her his desire, it is called a "kiss that\u000aawakens." On such an occasion the woman may pretend to be asleep at the\u000atime of her lover's arrival, so that she may know his intention and\u000aobtain respect from him.\u000a\u000aWhen a person kisses the reflection of the person he loves in a mirror,\u000ain water, or on a wall, it is called a "kiss showing the intention."\u000a\u000aWhen a person kisses a child sitting on his lap, or a picture, or an\u000aimage, or figure, in the presence of the person beloved by him, it is\u000acalled a "transferred kiss."\u000a\u000aWhen at night at a theatre, or in an assembly of caste men, a man coming\u000aup to a woman kisses a finger of her hand if she be standing, or a toe\u000aof her foot if she be sitting, or when a woman is shampooing her lover's\u000abody, places her face on his thigh (as if she was sleepy) so as to\u000ainflame his passion, and kisses his thigh or great toe, it is called a\u000a"demonstrative kiss."\u000a\u000aThere is also a verse on the subject as follows:--\u000a\u000a"Whatever things may be done by one of the lovers to the other, the same\u000ashould be returned by the other, _i.e._, if the woman kisses him he should\u000akiss her in return, if she strikes him he should also strike her in\u000areturn."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER IV.\u000a\u000aON PRESSING, OR MARKING, OR SCRATCHING WITH THE NAILS.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen love becomes intense, pressing with the nails or scratching the\u000abody with them is practised, and it is done on the following occasions:\u000aOn the first visit; at the time of setting out on a journey; on the\u000areturn from a journey; at the time when an angry lover is reconciled;\u000aand lastly when the woman is intoxicated.\u000a\u000aBut pressing with the nails is not an usual thing except with those who\u000aare intensely passionate, _i.e._, full of passion. It is employed together\u000awith biting, by those to whom the practice is agreeable.\u000a\u000aPressing with the nails is of the eight following kinds, according to\u000athe forms of the marks which are produced, viz.:\u000a\u000a1. Sounding.\u000a\u000a2. Half moon.\u000a\u000a3. A circle.\u000a\u000a4. A line.\u000a\u000a5. A tiger's nail or claw.\u000a\u000a6. A peacock's foot.\u000a\u000a7. The jump of a hare.\u000a\u000a8. The leaf of a blue lotus.\u000a\u000aThe places that are to be pressed with the nails are as follows: the arm\u000apit, the throat, the breasts, the lips, the jaghana, or middle parts of\u000athe body, and the thighs. But Suvarnanabha is of opinion that when the\u000aimpetuosity of passion is excessive, then the places need not be\u000aconsidered.\u000a\u000aThe qualities of good nails are that they should be bright, well set,\u000aclean, entire, convex, soft, and glossy in appearance. Nails are of\u000athree kinds according to their size, viz.:\u000a\u000a   Small.\u000a   Middling.\u000a   Large.\u000a\u000aLarge nails, which give grace to the hands, and attract the hearts of\u000awomen from their appearance, are possessed by the Bengalees.\u000a\u000aSmall nails, which can be used in various ways, and are to be applied\u000aonly with the object of giving pleasure, are possessed by the people of\u000athe southern districts.\u000a\u000aMiddling nails, which contain the properties of both the above kinds,\u000abelong to the people of the Maharashtra.\u000a\u000a(1). When a person presses the chin, the breasts, the lower lip, or the\u000ajaghana of another so softly that no scratch or mark is left, but only\u000athe hair on the body becomes erect from the touch of the nails, and the\u000anails themselves make a sound, it is called a "sounding or pressing with\u000athe nails."\u000a\u000aThis pressing is used in the case of a young girl when her lover\u000ashampoos her, scratches her head, and wants to trouble or frighten her.\u000a\u000a(2). The curved mark with the nails, which is impressed on the neck and\u000athe breasts, is called the "half moon."\u000a\u000a(3). When the half moons are impressed opposite to each other, it is\u000acalled a "circle." This mark with the nails is generally made on the\u000anavel, the small cavities about the buttocks, and on the joints of the\u000athigh.\u000a\u000a(4). A mark in the form of a small line, and which can be made on any\u000apart of the body, is called a "line."\u000a\u000a(5). This same line, when it is curved, and made on the breast, is\u000acalled a "tiger's nail."\u000a\u000a(6). When a curved mark is made on the breast by means of the five\u000anails, it is called a "peacock's foot." This mark is made with the\u000aobject of being praised, for it requires a great deal of skill to make\u000ait properly.\u000a\u000a(7). When five marks with the nails are made close to one another near\u000athe nipple of the breast, it is called "the jump of a hare."\u000a\u000a(8). A mark made on the breast or on the hips in the form of a leaf of\u000athe blue lotus, is called the "leaf of a blue lotus."\u000a\u000aWhen a person is going on a journey, and makes a mark on the thighs, or\u000aon the breast, it is called a "token of remembrance." On such an\u000aoccasion three or four lines are impressed close to one another with the\u000anails.\u000a\u000aHere ends the marking with the nails. Marks of other kinds than the\u000aabove may also be made with the nails, for the ancient authors say,\u000athat as there are innumerable degrees of skill among men (the practice\u000aof this art being known to all), so there are innumerable ways of making\u000athese marks. And as pressing or marking with the nails is independent of\u000alove, no one can say with certainty how many different kinds of marks\u000awith the nails do actually exist. The reason of this is, Vatsyayana\u000asays, that as variety is necessary in love, so love is to be produced by\u000ameans of variety. It is on this account that courtezans, who are well\u000aacquainted with various ways and means, become so desirable, for if\u000avariety is sought in all the arts and amusements, such as archery and\u000aothers, how much more should it be sought after in the present case.\u000a\u000aThe marks of the nails should not be made on married women, but\u000aparticular kinds of marks may be made on their private parts for the\u000aremembrance and increase of love.\u000a\u000aThere are also some verses on the subject, as follows:\u000a\u000a"The love of a woman who sees the marks of nails on the private parts of\u000aher body, even though they are old and almost worn out, becomes again\u000afresh and new. If there be no marks of nails to remind a person of the\u000apassages of love, then love is lessened in the same way as when no union\u000atakes place for a long time."\u000a\u000aEven when a stranger sees at a distance a young woman with the marks of\u000anails on her breast,[37] he is filled with love and respect for her.\u000a\u000aA man, also, who carries the marks of nails and teeth on some parts of\u000ahis body, influences the mind of a woman, even though it be ever so\u000afirm. In short, nothing tends to increase love so much as the effects of\u000amarking with the nails, and biting.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 37: From this it would appear that in ancient times the\u000abreasts of women were not covered, and this is seen in the painting of\u000athe Ajunta and other caves, where we find that the breasts of even royal\u000aladies and others are exposed.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER V.\u000a\u000aON BITING, AND THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED WITH REGARD TO WOMEN OF\u000aDIFFERENT COUNTRIES.\u000a\u000a\u000aAll the places that can be kissed, are also the places that can be\u000abitten, except the upper lip, the interior of the mouth, and the eyes.\u000a\u000aThe qualities of good teeth are as follows: They should be equal,\u000apossessed of a pleasing brightness, capable of being coloured, of proper\u000aproportions, unbroken, and with sharp ends.\u000a\u000aThe defects of teeth on the other hand are, that they are blunt,\u000aprotruding from the gums, rough, soft, large, and loosely set.\u000a\u000aThe following are the different kinds of biting, viz.:\u000a\u000a   The hidden bite.\u000a   The swollen bite.\u000a   The point.\u000a   The line of points.\u000a   The coral and the jewel.\u000a   The line of jewels.\u000a   The broken cloud.\u000a   The biting of the boar.\u000a\u000a(1). The biting which is shown only by the excessive redness of the skin\u000athat is bitten, is called the "hidden bite."\u000a\u000a(2). When the skin is pressed down on both sides, it is called the\u000a"swollen bite."\u000a\u000a(3). When a small portion of the skin is bitten with two teeth only, it\u000ais called the "point."\u000a\u000a(4). When such small portions of the skin are bitten with all the teeth,\u000ait is called the "line of points."\u000a\u000a(5). The biting which is done by bringing together the teeth and the\u000alips, is called the "coral and the jewel." The lip is the coral, and the\u000ateeth the jewel.\u000a\u000a(6). When biting is done with all the teeth, it is called the "line of\u000ajewels."\u000a\u000a(7). The biting which consists of unequal risings in a circle, and which\u000acomes from the space between the teeth, is called the "broken cloud."\u000aThis is impressed on the breasts.\u000a\u000a(8). The biting which consists of many broad rows of marks near to one\u000aanother, and with red intervals, is called the "biting of a boar." This\u000ais impressed on the breasts and the shoulders; and these two last modes\u000aof biting are peculiar to persons of intense passion.\u000a\u000aThe lower lip is the place on which the "hidden bite," the "swollen\u000abite," and the "point" are made; again the "swollen bite," and the\u000a"coral and the jewel" bite are done on the cheek. Kissing, pressing with\u000athe nails, and biting are the ornaments of the left cheek, and when the\u000aword cheek is used it is to be understood as the left cheek.\u000a\u000aBoth the "line of points" and the "line of jewels" are to be impressed\u000aon the throat, the arm pit, and the joints of the thighs; but the "line\u000aof points" alone is to be impressed on the forehead and the thighs.\u000a\u000aThe marking with the nails, and the biting of the following things,\u000aviz., an ornament of the forehead, an ear ornament, a bunch of flowers,\u000aa betel leaf, or a tamala leaf, which are worn by, or belong to the\u000awoman that is beloved, are signs of the desire of enjoyment.\u000a\u000aHere end the different kinds of biting.\u000a\u000a       *       *       *       *       *\u000a\u000aIn the affairs of love a man should do such things as are agreeable to\u000athe women of different countries.\u000a\u000aThe women of the central countries (_i.e._, between the Ganges and the\u000aJumna) are noble in their character, not accustomed to disgraceful\u000apractices, and dislike pressing the nails and biting.\u000a\u000aThe women of the Balhika country are gained over by striking.\u000a\u000aThe women of Avantika are fond of foul pleasures, and have not good\u000amanners.\u000a\u000aThe women of the Maharashtra are fond of practising the sixty-four arts,\u000athey utter low and harsh words, and like to be spoken to in the same\u000away, and have an impetuous desire of enjoyment.\u000a\u000aThe women of Pataliputra (_i.e._, the modern Patna) are of the same nature\u000aas the women of the Maharashtra, but show their likings only in secret.\u000a\u000aThe women of the Dravida country, though they are rubbed and pressed\u000aabout at the time of sexual enjoyment, have a slow fall of semen, that\u000ais they are very slow in the act of coition.\u000a\u000aThe women of Vanavasi are moderately passionate, they go through every\u000akind of enjoyment, cover their bodies, and abuse those who utter low,\u000amean and harsh words.\u000a\u000aThe women of Avanti hate kissing, marking with the nails, and biting,\u000abut they have a fondness for various kinds of sexual union.\u000a\u000aThe women of Malwa like embracing and kissing, but not wounding, and\u000athey are gained over by striking.\u000a\u000aThe women of Abhira, and those of the country about the Indus and five\u000arivers (_i.e._, the Punjab), are gained over by the Auparishtaka or mouth\u000acongress.\u000a\u000aThe women of Aparatika are full of passion, and make slowly the sound\u000a"Sit."\u000a\u000aThe women of the Lat country have even more impetuous desire, and also\u000amake the sound "Sit."\u000a\u000aThe women of the Stri Rajya, and of Koshola (Oude), are full of\u000aimpetuous desire, their semen falls in large quantities, and they are\u000afond of taking medicine to make it do so.\u000a\u000aThe women of the Audhra country have tender bodies, they are fond of\u000aenjoyment, and have a liking for voluptuous pleasures.\u000a\u000aThe women of Ganda have tender bodies, and speak sweetly.\u000a\u000aNow Suvarnanabha is of opinion that that which is agreeable to the\u000anature of a particular person, is of more consequence than that which is\u000aagreeable to a whole nation, and that therefore the peculiarities of the\u000acountry should not be observed in such cases. The various pleasures, the\u000adress, and the sports of one country are in time borrowed by another,\u000aand in such a case these things must be considered as belonging\u000aoriginally to that country.\u000a\u000aAmong the things mentioned above, viz., embracing, kissing, etc., those\u000awhich increase passion should be done first, and those which are only\u000afor amusement or variety should be done afterwards.\u000a\u000aThere are also some verses on this subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"When a man bites a woman forcibly, she should angrily do the same to\u000ahim with double force. Thus a 'point' should be returned with a 'line of\u000apoints,' and a 'line of points' with a 'broken cloud,' and if she be\u000aexcessively chafed, she should at once begin a love quarrel with him. At\u000asuch a time she should take hold of her lover by the hair, and bend his\u000ahead down, and kiss his lower lip, and then, being intoxicated with\u000alove, she should shut her eyes and bite him in various places. Even by\u000aday, and in a place of public resort, when her lover shows her any mark\u000athat she may have inflicted on his body, she should smile at the sight\u000aof it, and turning her face as if she were going to chide him, she\u000ashould show him with an angry look the marks on her own body that have\u000abeen made by him. Thus if men and women act according to each other's\u000aliking, their love for each other will not be lessened even in one\u000ahundred years."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER VI.\u000a\u000aOF THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF LYING DOWN, AND VARIOUS KINDS OF CONGRESS.\u000a\u000a\u000aOn the occasion of a "high congress" the Mrigi (Deer) woman should lie\u000adown in such a way as to widen her yoni, while in a "low congress" the\u000aHastini (Elephant) woman should lie down so as to contract hers. But in\u000aan "equal congress" they should lie down in the natural position. What\u000ais said above concerning the Mrigi and the Hastini applies also to the\u000aVadawa (Mare) woman. In a "low congress" the women should particularly\u000amake use of medicine, to cause her desires to be satisfied quickly.\u000a\u000aThe Deer-woman has the following three ways of lying down.\u000a\u000a   The widely opened position.\u000a   The yawning position.\u000a   The position of the wife of Indra.\u000a\u000a(1). When she lowers her head and raises her middle parts, it is called\u000athe "widely opened position." At such a time the man should apply some\u000aunguent, so as to make the entrance easy.\u000a\u000a(2). When she raises her thighs and keeps them wide apart and engages in\u000acongress, it is called the "yawning position."\u000a\u000a(3). When she places her thighs with her legs doubled on them upon her\u000asides, and thus engages in congress, it is called the position of\u000aIndrani, and this is learnt only by practice. The position is also\u000auseful in the case of the "highest congress."\u000a\u000aThe "clasping position" is used in "low congress," and in the "lowest\u000acongress," together with the "pressing position," the "twining\u000aposition", and the "mare's position."\u000a\u000aWhen the legs of both the male and the female are stretched straight\u000aout over each other, it is called the "clasping position." It is of two\u000akinds, the side position and the supine position, according to the way\u000ain which they lie down. In the side position the male should invariably\u000alie on his left side, and cause the woman to lie on her right side, and\u000athis rule is to be observed in lying down with all kinds of women.\u000a\u000aWhen, after congress has begun in the clasping position, the woman\u000apresses her lover with her thighs, it is called the "pressing position."\u000a\u000aWhen the woman places one of her thighs across the thigh of her lover,\u000ait is called the "twining position."\u000a\u000aWhen a woman forcibly holds in her yoni the lingam after it is in, it is\u000acalled the "mare's position." This is learnt by practice only, and is\u000achiefly found among the women of the Andra country.\u000a\u000aThe above are the different ways of lying down, mentioned by Babhravya;\u000aSuvarnanabha, however, gives the following in addition.\u000a\u000aWhen the female raises both of her thighs straight up, it is called the\u000a"rising position."\u000a\u000aWhen she raises both of her legs, and places them on her lover's\u000ashoulders, it is called the "yawning position."\u000a\u000aWhen the legs are contracted, and thus held by the lover before his\u000abosom, it is called the "pressed position."\u000a\u000aWhen only one of her legs is stretched out, it is called the "half\u000apressed position."\u000a\u000aWhen the woman places one of her legs on her lover's shoulder, and\u000astretches the other out, and then places the latter on his shoulder, and\u000astretches out the other, and continues to do so alternately, it is\u000acalled the "splitting of a bamboo."\u000a\u000aWhen one of her legs is placed on the head, and the other is stretched\u000aout, it is called the "fixing of a nail." This is learnt by practice\u000aonly.\u000a\u000aWhen both the legs of the woman are contracted, and placed on her\u000astomach, it is called the "crab's position."\u000a\u000aWhen the thighs are raised and placed one upon the other, it is called\u000athe "packed position."\u000a\u000aWhen the shanks are placed one upon the other, it is called the\u000a"lotus-like position."\u000a\u000aWhen a man, during congress, turns round, and enjoys the woman without\u000aleaving her, while she embraces him round the back all the time, it is\u000acalled the "turning position," and is learnt only by practice.\u000a\u000aThus says Suvarnanabha, these different ways of lying down, sitting, and\u000astanding should be practised in water, because it is easy to do so\u000atherein. But Vatsyayana is of opinion that congress in water is\u000aimproper, because it is prohibited by the religious law.\u000a\u000aWhen a man and a woman support themselves on each other's bodies, or on\u000aa wall, or pillar, and thus while standing engage in congress, it is\u000acalled the "supported congress."\u000a\u000aWhen a man supports himself against a wall, and the woman, sitting on\u000ahis hands joined together and held underneath her, throws her arms round\u000ahis neck, and putting her thighs alongside his waist, moves herself by\u000aher feet, which are touching the wall against which the man is leaning,\u000ait is called the "suspended congress."\u000a\u000aWhen a woman stands on her hands and feet like a quadruped, and her\u000alover mounts her like a bull, it is called the "congress of a cow." At\u000athis time everything that is ordinarily done on the bosom should be done\u000aon the back.\u000a\u000aIn the same way can be carried on the congress of a dog, the congress of\u000aa goat, the congress of a deer, the forcible mounting of an ass, the\u000acongress of a cat, the jump of a tiger, the pressing of an elephant, the\u000arubbing of a boar, and the mounting of a horse. And in all these cases\u000athe characteristics of these different animals should be manifested by\u000aacting like them.\u000a\u000aWhen a man enjoys two women at the same time, both of whom love him\u000aequally, it is called the "united congress."\u000a\u000aWhen a man enjoys many women altogether, it is called the "congress of a\u000aherd of cows."\u000a\u000aThe following kinds of congress, viz., sporting in water, or the\u000acongress of an elephant with many female elephants, which is said to\u000atake place only in the water, the congress of a collection of goats, the\u000acongress of a collection of deer, take place in imitation of these\u000aanimals.\u000a\u000aIn Gramaneri many young men enjoy a woman that may be married to one of\u000athem, either one after the other, or at the same time. Thus one of them\u000aholds her, another enjoys her, a third uses her mouth, a fourth holds\u000aher middle part, and in this way they go on enjoying her several parts\u000aalternately.\u000a\u000aThe same things can be done when several men are sitting in company with\u000aone courtesan, or when one courtesan is alone with many men. In the same\u000away this can be done by the women of the King's harem when they\u000aaccidentally get hold of a man.\u000a\u000aThe people in the Southern countries have also a congress in the anus,\u000athat is called the "lower congress."\u000a\u000aThus ends the various kinds of congress. There are also two verses on\u000athe subject as follows.\u000a\u000a"An ingenious person should multiply the kinds of congress after the\u000afashion of the different kinds of beasts and of birds. For these\u000adifferent kinds of congress, performed according to the usage of each\u000acountry, and the liking of each individual, generate love, friendship,\u000aand respect in the hearts of women."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER VII.\u000a\u000aOF THE VARIOUS MODES OF STRIKING, AND OF THE SOUNDS APPROPRIATE TO THEM.\u000a\u000a\u000aSexual intercourse can be compared to a quarrel, on account of the\u000acontrarieties of love and its tendency to dispute. The place of striking\u000awith passion is the body, and on the body the special places are:\u000a\u000a   The shoulders.\u000a   The head.\u000a   The space between the breasts.\u000a   The back.\u000a   The jaghana, or middle part of the body.\u000a   The sides.\u000a\u000aStriking is of four kinds, viz.:\u000a\u000a   Striking with the back of the hand.\u000a   Striking with the fingers a little contracted.\u000a   Striking with the fist.\u000a   Striking with the open palm of the hand.\u000a\u000aOn account of its causing pain, striking gives rise to the hissing\u000asound, which is of various kinds, and to the eight kinds of crying,\u000aviz.:\u000a\u000a   The sound Hin.\u000a   The thundering sound.\u000a   The cooing sound.\u000a   The weeping sound.\u000a   The sound Phut.\u000a   The sound Phât.\u000a   The sound Sût.\u000a   The sound Plât.\u000a\u000aBesides these, there are also words having a meaning, such as "mother,"\u000aand those that are expressive of prohibition, sufficiency, desire of\u000aliberation, pain or praise, and to which may be added sounds like those\u000aof the dove, the cuckoo, the green pigeon, the parrot, the bee, the\u000asparrow, the flamingo, the duck, and the quail, which are all\u000aoccasionally made use of.\u000a\u000aBlows with the fist should be given on the back of the woman, while she\u000ais sitting on the lap of the man, and she should give blows in return,\u000aabusing the man as if she were angry, and making the cooing and the\u000aweeping sounds. While the woman is engaged in congress the space between\u000athe breasts should be struck with the back of the hand, slowly at first,\u000aand then proportionately to the increasing excitement, until the end.\u000a\u000aAt this time the sounds Hin and others may be made, alternately or\u000aoptionally, according to habit. When the man, making the sound Phât,\u000astrikes the woman on the head, with the fingers of his hand a little\u000acontracted, it is called Prasritaka, which means striking with the\u000afingers of the hand a little contracted. In this case the appropriate\u000asounds are the cooing sound, the sound Phât, and the sound Phut in the\u000ainterior of the mouth, and at the end of congress the sighing and\u000aweeping sounds. The sound Phât is an imitation of the sound of a bamboo\u000abeing split, while the sound Phut is like the sound made by something\u000afalling into water. At all times when kissing and such like things are\u000abegun, the woman should give a reply with a hissing sound. During the\u000aexcitement when the woman is not accustomed to striking, she continually\u000autters words expressive of prohibition, sufficiently, or desire of\u000aliberation, as well as the words "father," "mother," intermingled with\u000athe sighing, weeping and thundering sounds.[38] Towards the conclusion\u000aof the congress, the breasts, the jaghana, and the sides of the woman\u000ashould be pressed with the open palms of the hand, with some force,\u000auntil the end of it, and then sounds like those of the quail, or the\u000agoose should be made.\u000a\u000aThere are also two verses on the subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"The characteristics of manhood are said to consist of roughness and\u000aimpetuosity, while weakness, tenderness, sensibility, and an inclination\u000ato turn away from unpleasant things are the distinguishing marks of\u000awomanhood. The excitement of passion, and peculiarities of habit may\u000asometimes cause contrary results to appear, but these do not last long,\u000aand in the end the natural state is resumed."\u000a\u000aThe wedge on the bosom, the scissors on the head, the piercing\u000ainstrument on the cheeks, and the pinchers on the breasts and sides, may\u000aalso be taken into consideration with the other four modes of striking,\u000aand thus give eight ways altogether. But these four ways of striking\u000awith instruments are peculiar to the people of the southern countries,\u000aand the marks caused by them are seen on the breasts of their women.\u000aThey are local peculiarities, but Vatsyayana is of opinion that the\u000apractice of them is painful, barbarous, and base, and quite unworthy of\u000aimitation.\u000a\u000aIn the same way anything that is a local peculiarity should not always\u000abe adopted elsewhere, and even in the place where the practice is\u000aprevalent, excess of it should always be avoided. Instances of the\u000adangerous use of them may be given as follows. The King of the Panchalas\u000akilled the courtezan Madhavasena by means of the wedge during congress.\u000aKing Shatakarni Shatavahana of the Kuntalas deprived his great Queen\u000aMalayavati of her life by a pair of scissors, and Naradeva, whose hand\u000awas deformed, blinded a dancing girl by directing a piercing instrument\u000ain a wrong way.\u000a\u000aThere are also two verses on the subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"About these things there cannot be either enumeration or any definite\u000arule. Congress having once commenced, passion alone gives birth to all\u000athe acts of the parties."\u000a\u000aSuch passionate actions and amorous gesticulations or movements, which\u000aarise on the spur of the moment, and during sexual intercourse, cannot\u000abe defined, and are as irregular as dreams. A horse having once attained\u000athe fifth degree of motion goes on with blind speed, regardless of pits,\u000aditches, and posts in his way; and in the same manner a loving pair\u000abecome blind with passion in the heat of congress, and go on with great\u000aimpetuosity, paying not the least regard to excess. For this reason one\u000awho is well acquainted with the science of love, and knowing his own\u000astrength, as also the tenderness, impetuosity, and strength of the young\u000awoman, should act accordingly. The various modes of enjoyment are not\u000afor all times or for all persons, but they should only be used at the\u000aproper time, and in the proper countries and places.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 38: Men who are well acquainted with the art of love are well\u000aaware how often one woman differs from another in her sighs and sounds\u000aduring the time of congress. Some women like to be talked to in the most\u000aloving way, others in the most abusive way, and so on. Some women enjoy\u000athemselves with closed eyes in silence, others make a great noise over\u000ait, and some almost faint away. The great art is to ascertain what gives\u000athem the greatest pleasure, and what specialities they like best.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER VIII.\u000a\u000aABOUT WOMEN ACTING THE PART OF A MAN; AND OF THE WORK OF A MAN.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen a woman sees that her lover is fatigued by constant congress,\u000awithout having his desire satisfied, she should, with his permission,\u000alay him down upon his back, and give him assistance by acting his part.\u000aShe may also do this to satisfy the curiosity of her lover, or her own\u000adesire of novelty.\u000a\u000aThere are two ways of doing this, the first is when during congress she\u000aturns round, and gets on the top of her lover, in such a manner as to\u000acontinue the congress, without obstructing the pleasure of it; and the\u000aother is when she acts the man's part from the beginning. At such a\u000atime, with flowers in her hair hanging loose, and her smiles broken by\u000ahard breathings, she should press upon her lover's bosom with her own\u000abreasts, and lowering her head frequently, should do in return the same\u000aactions which he used to do before, returning his blows and chaffing\u000ahim, should say, "I was laid down by you, and fatigued with hard\u000acongress, I shall now therefore lay you down in return." She should then\u000aagain manifest her own bashfulness, her fatigue, and her desire of\u000astopping the congress. In this way she should do the work of a man,\u000awhich we shall presently relate.\u000a\u000aWhatever is done by a man for giving pleasure to a woman is called the\u000awork of a man, and is as follows:--\u000a\u000aWhile the woman is lying on his bed, and is as it were abstracted by his\u000aconversation, he should loosen the knot of her under garments, and when\u000ashe begins to dispute with him, he should overwhelm her with kisses.\u000aThen when his lingam is erect he should touch her with his hands in\u000avarious places, and gently manipulate various parts of the body. If the\u000awoman is bashful, and if it is the first time that they have come\u000atogether, the man should place his hands between her thighs, which she\u000awould probably keep close together, and if she is a very young girl, he\u000ashould first get his hands upon her breasts, which she would probably\u000acover with her own hands, and under her armpits and on her neck. If\u000ahowever she is a seasoned woman, he should do whatever is agreeable\u000aeither to him or to her, and whatever is fitting for the occasion. After\u000athis he should take hold of her hair, and hold her chin in his fingers\u000afor the purpose of kissing her. On this, if she is a young girl, she\u000awill become bashful and close her eyes. Any how he should gather from\u000athe action of the woman what things would be pleasing to her during\u000acongress.\u000a\u000aHere Suvarnanabha says that while a man is doing to the woman what he\u000alikes best during congress, he should always make a point of pressing\u000athose parts of her body on which she turns her eyes.\u000a\u000aThe signs of the enjoyment and satisfaction of the women are as follows:\u000aher body relaxes, she closes her eyes, she puts aside all bashfulness,\u000aand shows increased willingness to unite the two organs as closely\u000atogether as possible. On the other hand, the signs of her want of\u000aenjoyment and of failing to be satisfied are as follows: she shakes her\u000ahands, she does not let the man get up, feels dejected, bites the man,\u000akicks him, and continues to go on moving after the man has finished. In\u000asuch cases the man should rub the yoni of the woman with his hand and\u000afingers (as the elephant rubs anything with his trunk) before engaging\u000ain congress, until it is softened, and after that is done he should\u000aproceed to put his lingam into her.\u000a\u000aThe acts to be done by the man are:\u000a\u000a   Moving forward.\u000a   Friction or churning.\u000a   Piercing.\u000a   Rubbing.\u000a   Pressing.\u000a   Giving a blow.\u000a   The blow of a boar.\u000a   The blow of a bull.\u000a   The sporting of a sparrow.\u000a\u000a(1). When the organs are brought together properly and directly it is\u000acalled "moving the organ forward."\u000a\u000a(2). When the lingam is held with the hand, and turned all round in the\u000ayoni, it is called "churning."\u000a\u000a(3). When the yoni is lowered, and the upper part of it is struck with\u000athe lingam, it is called "piercing."\u000a\u000a(4). When the same thing is done on the lower part of the yoni, it is\u000acalled "rubbing."\u000a\u000a(5). When the yoni is pressed by the lingam for a long time, it is\u000acalled "pressing."\u000a\u000a(6). When the lingam is removed to some distance from the yoni, and then\u000aforcibly strikes it, it is called "giving a blow."\u000a\u000a(7). When only one part of the yoni is rubbed with the lingam, it is\u000acalled the "blow of a boar."\u000a\u000a(8). When both sides of the yoni are rubbed in this way, it is called\u000athe "blow of a bull."\u000a\u000a(9). When the lingam is in the yoni, and moved up and down frequently,\u000aand without being taken out, it is called the "sporting of a sparrow."\u000aThis takes place at the end of congress.\u000a\u000aWhen a woman acts the part of a man, she has the following things to do\u000ain addition to the nine given above, viz.\u000a\u000a   The pair of tongs.\u000a   The top.\u000a   The swing.\u000a\u000a(1). When the woman holds the lingam in her yoni, draws it in, presses\u000ait, and keeps it thus in her for a long time, it is called the "pair of\u000atongs."\u000a\u000a(2). When, while engaged in congress, she turns round like a wheel, it\u000ais called the "top." This is learnt by practice only.\u000a\u000a(3). When, on such an occasion, the man lifts up the middle part of his\u000abody, and the woman turns round her middle part, it is called the\u000a"swing."\u000a\u000aWhen the woman is tired, she should place her forehead on that of her\u000alover, and should thus take rest without disturbing the union of the\u000aorgans, and when the woman has rested herself the man should turn round\u000aand begin the congress again.\u000a\u000aThere are also some verses on the subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"Though a woman is reserved, and keeps her feelings concealed, yet when\u000ashe gets on the top of a man, she then shows all her love and desire. A\u000aman should gather from the actions of the woman of what disposition she\u000ais, and in what way she likes to be enjoyed. A woman during her monthly\u000acourses, a woman who has been lately confined, and a fat woman should\u000anot be made to act the part of a man."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER XI.\u000a\u000aOF THE AUPARISHTAKA[39] OR MOUTH CONGRESS.\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are two kinds of eunuchs, those that are disguised as males, and\u000athose that are disguised as females. Eunuchs disguised as females\u000aimitate their dress, speech, gestures, tenderness, timidity, simplicity,\u000asoftness and bashfulness. The acts that are done on the jaghana or\u000amiddle parts of women, are done in the mouths of these eunuchs, and this\u000ais called Auparishtaka. These eunuchs derive their imaginable pleasure,\u000aand their livelihood from this kind of congress, and they lead the life\u000aof courtezans. So much concerning eunuchs disguised as females.\u000a\u000aEunuchs disguised as males keep their desires secret, and when they wish\u000ato do anything they lead the life of shampooers. Under the pretence of\u000ashampooing, an eunuch of this kind embraces and draws towards himself\u000athe thighs of the man whom he is shampooing, and after this he touches\u000athe joints of his thighs and his jaghana, or central portions of his\u000abody. Then, if he finds the lingam of the man erect, he presses it with\u000ahis hands, and chaffs him for getting into that state. If after this,\u000aand after knowing his intention, the man does not tell the eunuch to\u000aproceed, then the latter does it of his own accord and begins the\u000acongress. If however he is ordered by the man to do it, then he disputes\u000awith him, and only consents at last with difficulty.\u000a\u000aThe following eight things are then done by the eunuch one after the\u000aother, viz.\u000a\u000a   The nominal congress.\u000a   Biting the sides.\u000a   Pressing outside.\u000a   Pressing inside.\u000a   Kissing.\u000a   Rubbing.\u000a   Sucking a mangoe fruit.\u000a   Swallowing up.\u000a\u000aAt the end of each of these the eunuch expresses his wish to stop, but\u000awhen one of them is finished, the man desires him to do another, and\u000aafter that is done, then the one that follows it, and so on.\u000a\u000a(1). When, holding the man's lingam with his hand, and placing it\u000abetween his lips, the eunuch moves about his mouth, it is called the\u000a"nominal congress."\u000a\u000a(2). When, covering the end of the lingam with his fingers collected\u000atogether like the bud of a plant or flower, the eunuch presses the sides\u000aof it with his lips, using his teeth also, it is called "biting the\u000asides."\u000a\u000a(3). When, being desired to proceed, the eunuch presses the end of the\u000alingam with his lips closed together, and kisses it as if he were\u000adrawing it out, it is called the "outside pressing."\u000a\u000a(4). When, being asked to go on, he put the lingam further into his\u000amouth, and presses it with his lips and then takes it out, it is called\u000athe "inside pressing."\u000a\u000a(5). When, holding the lingam in his hand, the eunuch kisses it as if he\u000awere kissing the lower lip, it is called "kissing."\u000a\u000a(6). When, after kissing it, he touches it with his tongue everywhere,\u000aand passes the tongue over the end of it, it is called "rubbing."\u000a\u000a(7). When, in the same way, he puts the half of it into his mouth, and\u000aforcibly kisses and sucks it, this is called "sucking a mangoe fruit."\u000a\u000a(8). And lastly, when, with the consent of the man, the eunuch puts the\u000awhole lingam into his mouth, and presses it to the very end, as if he\u000awere going to swallow it up, it is called "swallowing up."\u000a\u000aStriking, scratching, and other things may also be done during this kind\u000aof congress.\u000a\u000aThe Auparishtaka is practised only by unchaste and wanton women, female\u000aattendants and serving maids, _i.e._, those who are not married to\u000aanybody, but who live by shampooing.\u000a\u000aThe Acharyas (_i.e._, ancient and venerable authors) are of opinion that\u000athis Auparishtaka is the work of a dog and not of a man, because it is a\u000alow practice, and opposed to the orders of the Holy Writ, and because\u000athe man himself suffers by bringing his lingam into contact with the\u000amouths of eunuchs and women. But Vatsyayana says that the orders of the\u000aHoly Writ do not affect those who resort to courtezans, and the law\u000aprohibits the practice of the Auparishtaka with married women only. As\u000aregards the injury to the male, that can be easily remedied.\u000a\u000aThe people of Eastern India do not resort to women who practise the\u000aAuparishtaka.\u000a\u000aThe people of Ahichhatra resort to such women, but do nothing with them,\u000aso far as the mouth is concerned.\u000a\u000aThe people of Saketa do with these women every kind of mouth congress,\u000awhile the people of Nagara do not practise this, but do every other\u000athing.\u000a\u000aThe people of the Shurasena country, on the southern bank of the Jumna,\u000ado everything without any hesitation, for they say that women being\u000anaturally unclean, no one can be certain about their character, their\u000apurity, their conduct, their practices, their confidences, or their\u000aspeech. They are not however on this account to be abandoned, because\u000areligious law, on the authority of which they are reckoned pure, lays\u000adown that the udder of a cow is clean at the time of milking, though the\u000amouth of a cow, and also the mouth of her calf, are considered unclean\u000aby the Hindoos. Again a dog is clean when he seizes a deer in hunting,\u000athough food touched by a dog is otherwise considered very unclean. A\u000abird is clean when it causes a fruit to fall from a tree by pecking at\u000ait, though things eaten by crows and other birds are considered unclean.\u000aAnd the mouth of a woman is clean for kissing and such like things at\u000athe time of sexual intercourse. Vatsyayana moreover thinks that in all\u000athese things connected with love, everybody should act according to the\u000acustom of his country, and his own inclination.\u000a\u000aThere are also the following verses on the subject.\u000a\u000a"The male servants of some men carry on the mouth congress with their\u000amasters. It is also practised by some citizens, who know each other\u000awell, among themselves. Some women of the harem, when they are amorous,\u000ado the acts of the mouth on the yonis of one another, and some men do\u000athe same thing with women. The way of doing this (_i.e._, of kissing the\u000ayoni) should be known from kissing the mouth. When a man and woman lie\u000adown in an inverted order, _i.e._, with the head of the one towards the\u000afeet of the other and carry on this congress, it is called the "congress\u000aof a crow."\u000a\u000aFor the sake of such things courtezans abandon men possessed of good\u000aqualities, liberal and clever, and become attached to low persons, such\u000aas slaves and elephant drivers. The Auparishtaka, or mouth congress,\u000ashould never be done by a learned Brahman, by a minister that carries on\u000athe business of a state, or by a man of good reputation, because though\u000athe practice is allowed by the Shastras, there is no reason why it\u000ashould be carried on, and need only be practised in particular cases. As\u000afor instance, the taste, and the strength, and the digestive qualities\u000aof the flesh of dogs are mentioned in works on medicine, but it does not\u000atherefore follow that it should be eaten by the wise. In the same way\u000athere are some men, some places and some times, with respect to which\u000athese practices can be made use of. A man should therefore pay regard to\u000athe place, to the time, and to the practice which is to be carried out,\u000aas also as to whether it is agreeable to his nature and to himself, and\u000athen he may or may not practise these things according to circumstances.\u000aBut after all, these things being done secretly, and the mind of the man\u000abeing fickle, how can it be known what any person will do at any\u000aparticular time and for any particular purpose.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 39: This practice appears to have been prevalent in some parts\u000aof India from a very ancient time. The "Shushruta," a work on medicine\u000asome two thousand years old, describes the wounding of the lingam with\u000athe teeth as one of the causes of a disease treated upon in that work.\u000aTraces of the practice are found as far back as the eighth century, for\u000avarious kinds of the Auparishtaka are represented in the sculptures of\u000amany Shaiva temples at Bhuvaneshwara, near Cuttack, in Orissa, and which\u000awere built about that period. From these sculptures being found in such\u000aplaces, it would seem that this practice was popular in that part of the\u000acountry at that time. It does not seem to be so prevalent now in\u000aHindustan, its place perhaps is filled up by the practice of sodomy,\u000aintroduced since the Mahomedan period.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER X.\u000a\u000aOF THE WAY HOW TO BEGIN AND HOW TO END THE CONGRESS.\u000a\u000aDIFFERENT KINDS OF CONGRESS AND LOVE QUARRELS.\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the pleasure-room, decorated with flowers, and fragrant with\u000aperfumes, attended by his friends and servants, the citizen should\u000areceive the woman, who will come bathed and dressed, and will invite her\u000ato take refreshment and to drink freely. He should then seat her on his\u000aleft side, and holding her hair, and touching also the end and knot of\u000aher garment, he should gently embrace her with his right arm. They\u000ashould then carry on an amusing conversation on various subjects, and\u000amay also talk suggestively of things which would be considered as\u000acoarse, or not to be mentioned generally in society. They may then sing,\u000aeither with or without gesticulations, and play on musical instruments,\u000atalk about the arts, and persuade each other to drink. At last when the\u000awoman is overcome with love and desire, the citizen should dismiss the\u000apeople that may be with him, giving them flowers, ointment, and betel\u000aleaves, and then when the two are left alone, they should proceed as has\u000abeen already described in the previous chapters.\u000a\u000aSuch is the beginning of sexual union. At the end of the congress, the\u000alovers with modesty, and not looking at each other, should go separately\u000ato the washing-room. After this, sitting in their own places, they\u000ashould eat some betel leaves, and the citizen should apply with his own\u000ahand to the body of the woman some pure sandal wood ointment, or\u000aointment of some other kind. He should then embrace her with his left\u000aarm, and with agreeable words should cause her to drink from a cup held\u000ain his own hand, or he may give her water to drink. They can then eat\u000asweetmeats, or anything else, according to their likings, and may drink\u000afresh juice,[40] soup, gruel, extracts of meat, sherbet, the juice of\u000amangoe fruits, the extract of the juice of the citron tree mixed with\u000asugar, or anything that may be liked in different countries, and known\u000ato be sweet, soft, and pure. The lovers may also sit on the terrace of\u000athe palace or house, and enjoy the moonlight, and carry on an agreeable\u000aconversation. At this time, too, while the woman lies in his lap, with\u000aher face towards the moon, the citizen should show her the different\u000aplanets, the morning star, the polar star, and the seven Rishis, or\u000aGreat Bear.\u000a\u000aThis is the end of sexual union.\u000a\u000aCongress is of the following kinds, viz.:\u000a\u000a   Loving congress.\u000a   Congress of subsequent love.\u000a   Congress of artificial love.\u000a   Congress of transferred love.\u000a   Congress like that of eunuchs.\u000a   Deceitful congress.\u000a   Congress of spontaneous love.\u000a\u000a(1). When a man and a woman, who have been in love with each other for\u000asome time, come together with great difficulty, or when one of the two\u000areturns from a journey, or is reconciled after having been separated on\u000aaccount of a quarrel, then congress is called the "loving congress." It\u000ais carried on according to the liking of the lovers, and as long as they\u000achoose.\u000a\u000a(2). When two persons come together, while their love for each other is\u000astill in its infancy, their congress is called the "congress of\u000asubsequent love."\u000a\u000a(3). When a man carries on the congress by exciting himself by means of\u000athe sixty-four ways, such as kissing, etc., etc., or when a man and a\u000awoman come together, though in reality they are both attached to\u000adifferent persons, their congress is then called "congress of artificial\u000alove." At this time all the ways and means mentioned in the Kama Shastra\u000ashould be used.\u000a\u000a(4). When a man, from the beginning to the end of the congress, though\u000ahaving connection with the women, thinks all the time that he is\u000aenjoying another one whom he loves, it is called the "congress of\u000atransferred love."\u000a\u000a(5). Congress between a man and a female water carrier, or a female\u000aservant of a caste lower than his own, lasting only until the desire is\u000asatisfied, is called "congress like that of eunuchs." Here external\u000atouches, kisses, and manipulations are not to be employed.\u000a\u000a(6). The congress between a courtezan and a rustic, and that between\u000acitizens and the women of villages, and bordering countries, is called,\u000a"deceitful congress."\u000a\u000a(7). The congress that takes place between two persons who are attached\u000ato one another, and which is done according to their own liking is\u000acalled "spontaneous congress."\u000a\u000aThus ends the kinds of congress.\u000a\u000aWe shall now speak of love quarrels.\u000a\u000aA woman who is very much in love with a man cannot bear to hear the name\u000aof her rival mentioned, or to have any conversation regarding her, or to\u000abe addressed by her name through mistake. If such takes place, a great\u000aquarrel arises, and the woman cries, becomes angry, tosses her hair\u000aabout, strikes her lover, falls from her bed or seat, and, casting aside\u000aher garlands and ornaments, throws herself down on the ground.\u000a\u000aAt this time, the lover should attempt to reconcile her with\u000aconciliatory words, and should take her up carefully and place her on\u000aher bed. But she, not replying to his questions, and with increased\u000aanger, should bend down his head by pulling his hair, and having kicked\u000ahim once, twice, or thrice on his arms, head, bosom or back, should then\u000aproceed to the door of the room. Dattaka says that she should then sit\u000aangrily near the door and shed tears, but should not go out, because she\u000awould be found fault with for going away. After a time, when she thinks\u000athat the conciliatory words and actions of her lover have reached their\u000autmost, she should then embrace him, talking to him with harsh and\u000areproachful words, but at the same time showing a loving desire for\u000acongress.\u000a\u000aWhen the woman is in her own house, and has quarrelled with her lover,\u000ashe should go to him and show how angry she is, and leave him.\u000aAfterwards the citizen having sent the Vita,[41] the Vidushaka[41] or\u000athe Pithamurda[41] to pacify her, she should accompany them back to the\u000ahouse, and spend the night with her lover.\u000a\u000aThus end the love quarrels.\u000a\u000aIn conclusion.\u000a\u000aA man, employing the sixty-four means mentioned by Babhravya, obtains\u000ahis object, and enjoys the woman of the first quality. Though he may\u000aspeak well on other subjects, if he does not know the sixty-four\u000adivisions, no great respect is paid to him in the assembly of the\u000alearned. A man, devoid of other knowledge, but well acquainted with the\u000asixty-four divisions, becomes a leader in any society of men and women.\u000aWhat man will not respect the sixty-four parts,[42] considering they are\u000arespected by the learned, by the cunning, and by the courtezans. As the\u000asixty-four parts are respected, are charming, and add to the talent of\u000awomen, they are called by the Acharyas dear to women. A man skilled in\u000athe sixty-four parts is looked upon with love by his own wife, by the\u000awives of others, and by courtezans.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTES:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 40: The fresh juice of the cocoa nut tree, the date tree, and\u000aother kinds of palm trees are drunk in India. It will not keep fresh\u000avery long, but ferments rapidly, and is then distilled into liquor.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 41: The characteristics of these three individuals have been\u000agiven in Part I. page 31.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 42: A definition of the sixty-four parts, or divisions, is\u000agiven in Chapter II., page 45.]\u000a\u000a=END OF PART II.=\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPART III.\u000a\u000aABOUT THE ACQUISITION OF A WIFE.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER I.\u000a\u000aON MARRIAGE.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen a girl of the same caste, and a virgin, is married in accordance\u000awith the precepts of Holy Writ, the results of such an union are: the\u000aacquisition of Dharma and Artha, offspring, affinity, increase of\u000afriends, and untarnished love. For this reason a man should fix his\u000aaffections upon a girl who is of good family, whose parents are alive,\u000aand who is three years or more younger than himself. She should be born\u000aof a highly respectable family, possessed of wealth, well connected, and\u000awith many relations and friends. She should also be beautiful, of a good\u000adisposition, with lucky marks on her body, and with good hair, nails,\u000ateeth, ears, eyes, and breasts, neither more nor less than they ought to\u000abe, and no one of them entirely wanting, and not troubled with a sickly\u000abody. The man should, of course, also possess these qualities himself.\u000aBut at all events, says Ghotakamukha, a girl who has been already joined\u000awith others (_i.e._, no longer a maiden) should never be loved, for it\u000awould be reproachable to do such a thing.\u000a\u000aNow in order to bring about a marriage with such a girl as described\u000aabove, the parents and relations of the man should exert themselves, as\u000aalso such friends on both sides as may be desired to assist in the\u000amatter. These friends should bring to the notice of the girl's parents,\u000athe faults, both present and future, of all the other men that may wish\u000ato marry her, and should at the same time extol even to exaggeration\u000aall the excellencies, ancestral, and paternal, of their friend, so as to\u000aendear him to them, and particularly to those that may be liked by the\u000agirl's mother. One of the friends should also disguise himself as an\u000aastrologer and declare the future good fortune and wealth of his friend\u000aby showing the existence of all the lucky omens[43] and signs,[44] the\u000agood influence of planets, the auspicious entrance of the sun into a\u000asign of the Zodiac, propitious stars and fortunate marks on his body.\u000aOthers again should rouse the jealousy of the girl's mother by telling\u000aher that their friend has a chance of getting from some other quarter\u000aeven a better girl than hers.\u000a\u000aA girl should be taken as a wife, as also given in marriage, when\u000afortune, signs, omens, and the words[45] of others are favourable, for,\u000asays Ghotakamukha, a man should not marry at any time he likes. A girl\u000awho is asleep, crying, or gone out of the house when sought in marriage,\u000aor who is betrothed to another, should not be married. The following\u000aalso should be avoided:\u000a\u000a   One who is kept concealed.\u000a   One who has an ill-sounding name.\u000a   One who has her nose depressed.\u000a   One who has her nostril turned up.\u000a   One who is formed like a male.\u000a   One who is bent down.\u000a   One who has crooked thighs.\u000a   One who has a projecting forehead.\u000a   One who has a bald head.\u000a   One who does not like purity.\u000a   One who has been polluted by another.\u000a   One who is afflicted with the Gulma.[46]\u000a   One who is disfigured in any way.\u000a   One who has fully arrived at puberty.\u000a   One who is a friend.\u000a   One who is a younger sister.\u000a   One who is a Varshakari.[47]\u000a\u000aIn the same way a girl who is called by the name of one of the\u000atwenty-seven stars, or by the name of a tree, or of a river, is\u000aconsidered worthless, as also a girl whose name ends in "r" or "l." But\u000asome authors say that prosperity is gained only by marrying that girl to\u000awhom one becomes attached, and that therefore no other girl but the one\u000awho is loved should be married by anyone.\u000a\u000aWhen a girl becomes marriageable her parents should dress her smartly,\u000aand should place her where she can be easily seen by all. Every\u000aafternoon, having dressed her and decorated her in a becoming manner,\u000athey should send her with her female companions to sports, sacrifices,\u000aand marriage ceremonies, and thus show her to advantage in society,\u000abecause she is a kind of merchandise. They should also receive with kind\u000awords and signs of friendliness those of an auspicious appearance who\u000amay come accompanied by their friends and relations for the purpose of\u000amarrying their daughter, and under some pretext or other having first\u000adressed her becomingly, should then present her to them. After this they\u000ashould await the pleasure of fortune, and with this object should\u000aappoint a future day on which a determination could be come to with\u000aregard to their daughter's marriage. On this occasion when the persons\u000ahave come, the parents of the girl should ask them to bathe and dine,\u000aand should say, "Everything will take place at the proper time," and\u000ashould not then comply with the request, but should settle the matter\u000alater.\u000a\u000aWhen a girl is thus acquired, either according to the custom of the\u000acountry, or according to his own desire, the man should marry her in\u000aaccordance with the precepts of the Holy Writ, according to one of the\u000afour kinds of marriage.\u000a\u000aThus ends marriage.\u000a\u000aThere are also some verses on the subject as follows:--\u000a\u000aAmusement in society, such as completing verses begun by others,\u000amarriages, and auspicious ceremonies should be carried on neither with\u000asuperiors, nor inferiors, but with our equals. That should be known as a\u000ahigh connection when a man, after marrying a girl, has to serve her and\u000aher relations afterwards like a servant, and such a connection is\u000acensured by the good. On the other hand, that reproachable connection,\u000awhere a man, together with his relations, lords it over his wife, is\u000acalled a low connection by the wise. But when both the man and the woman\u000aafford mutual pleasure to each other, and when the relatives on both\u000asides pay respect to one another, such is called a connection in the\u000aproper sense of the word. Therefore a man should contract neither a high\u000aconnection by which he is obliged to bow down afterwards to his kinsmen,\u000anor a low connection, which is universally reprehended by all.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTES:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 43: The flight of a blue jay on a person's left side is\u000aconsidered a lucky omen when one starts on any business; the appearance\u000aof a cat before anyone at such a time is looked on as a bad omen.

For the next seven days\u000athey should bathe amidst the sounds of auspicious musical instruments,\u000ashould decorate themselves, dine together, and pay attention to their\u000arelations as well as to those who may have come to witness their\u000amarriage. This is applicable to persons of all castes. On the night of\u000athe tenth day the man should begin in a lonely place with soft words,\u000aand thus create confidence in the girl. Some authors say that for the\u000apurpose of winning her over he should not speak to her for three days,\u000abut the followers of Babhravya are of opinion that if the man does not\u000aspeak with her for three days, the girl may be discouraged by seeing him\u000aspiritless like a pillar, and, becoming dejected, she may begin to\u000adespise him as an eunuch. Vatsyayana says that the man should begin to\u000awin her over, and to create confidence in her, but should abstain at\u000afirst from sexual pleasures. Women being of a tender nature, want tender\u000abeginnings, and when they are forcibly approached by men with whom they\u000aare but slightly acquainted, they sometimes suddenly become haters of\u000asexual connection, and sometimes even haters of the male sex. The man\u000ashould therefore approach the girl according to her liking, and should\u000amake use of those devices by which he may be able to establish himself\u000amore and more into her confidence. These devices are as follows:--\u000a\u000aHe should embrace her first of all in a way she likes most, because it\u000adoes not last for a long time.\u000a\u000aHe should embrace her with the upper part of his body because that is\u000aeasier and simpler. If the girl is grown up, or if the man has known\u000aher for some time, he may embrace her by the light of a lamp, but if he\u000ais not well acquainted with her, or if she is a young girl, he should\u000athen embrace her in darkness.\u000a\u000aWhen the girl accepts the embrace, the man should put a "tambula" or\u000ascrew of betel nut and betel leaves in her mouth, and if she will not\u000atake it, he should induce her to do so by conciliatory words,\u000aentreaties, oaths, and kneeling at her feet, for it is an universal rule\u000athat however bashful or angry a woman may be, she never disregards a man\u000akneeling at her feet. At the time of giving this "tambula" he should\u000akiss her mouth softly and gracefully without making any sound. When she\u000ais gained over in this respect he should then make her talk, and so that\u000ashe may be induced to talk he should ask her questions about things of\u000awhich he knows or pretends to know nothing, and which can be answered in\u000aa few words. If she does not speak to him, he should not frighten her,\u000abut should ask her the same thing again and again in a conciliatory\u000amanner. If she does not then speak he should urge her to give a reply,\u000abecause as Ghotakamukha says, "all girls hear everything said to them by\u000amen, but do not themselves sometimes say a single word." When she is\u000athus importuned, the girl should give replies by shakes of the head, but\u000aif she quarrelled with the man she should not even do that. When she is\u000aasked by the man whether she wishes for him, and whether she likes him,\u000ashe should remain silent for a long time, and when at last importuned to\u000areply, should give him a favourable answer by a nod of the head. If the\u000aman is previously acquainted with the girl he should converse with her\u000aby means of a female friend, who may be favourable to him, and in the\u000aconfidence of both, and carry on the conversation on both sides. On such\u000aan occasion the girl should smile with her head bent down, and if the\u000afemale friend say more on her part than she was desired to do, she\u000ashould chide her and dispute with her. The female friend should say in\u000ajest even what she is not desired to say by the girl, and add, "she says\u000aso," on which the girl should say indistinctly and prettily, "O no! I\u000adid not say so," and she should then smile and throw an occasional\u000aglance towards the man.\u000a\u000aIf the girl is familiar with the man, she should place near him,\u000awithout saying anything, the tambula, the ointment, or the garland that\u000ahe may have asked for, or she may tie them up in his upper garment.\u000aWhile she is engaged in this, the man should touch her young breasts in\u000athe sounding way of pressing with the nails, and if she prevents him\u000adoing this he should say to her, "I will not do it again if you will\u000aembrace me," and should in this way cause her to embrace him. While he\u000ais being embraced by her he should pass his hand repeatedly over and\u000aabout her body. By and bye he should place her in his lap, and try more\u000aand more to gain her consent, and if she will not yield to him he should\u000afrighten her by saying, "I shall impress marks of my teeth and nails on\u000ayour lips and breasts, and then make similar marks on my own body, and\u000ashall tell my friends that you did them. What will you say then?" In\u000athis and other ways, as fear and confidence are created in the minds of\u000achildren, so should the man gain her over to his wishes.\u000a\u000aOn the second and third nights, after her confidence has increased still\u000amore, he should feel the whole of her body with his hands, and kiss her\u000aall over; he should also place his hands upon her thighs and shampoo\u000athem, and if he succeed in this he should then shampoo the joints of her\u000athighs. If she tries to prevent him doing this he should say to her,\u000a"What harm is there in doing it?" and should persuade her to let him do\u000ait. After gaining this point he should touch her private parts, should\u000aloosen her girdle and the knot of her dress, and turning up her lower\u000agarment should shampoo the joints of her naked thighs. Under various\u000apretences he should do all these things, but he should not at that time\u000abegin actual congress. After this he should teach her the sixty-four\u000aarts, should tell her how much he loves her, and describe to her the\u000ahopes which he formerly entertained regarding her. He should also\u000apromise to be faithful to her in future, and should dispel all her fears\u000awith respect to rival women, and, at last, after having overcome her\u000abashfulness, he should begin to enjoy her in a way so as not to frighten\u000aher. So much about creating confidence in the girl; and there are,\u000amoreover, some verses on the subject as follows:--\u000a\u000aA man acting according to the inclinations of a girl should try and gain\u000aher over so that she may love him and place her confidence in him. A\u000aman does not succeed either by implicitly following the inclination of a\u000agirl, or by wholly opposing her, and he should therefore adopt a middle\u000acourse. He who knows how to make himself beloved by women, as well as to\u000aincrease their honour and create confidence in them, this man becomes an\u000aobject of their love. But he, who neglects a girl thinking she is too\u000abashful, is despised by her as a beast ignorant of the working of the\u000afemale mind. Moreover, a girl forcibly enjoyed by one who does not\u000aunderstand the hearts of girls becomes nervous, uneasy, and dejected,\u000aand suddenly begins to hate the man who has taken advantage of her; and\u000athen, when her love is not understood or returned, she sinks into\u000adespondency, and becomes either a hater of mankind altogether, or,\u000ahating her own man, she has recourse to other men.[48]\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 48: These last few lines have been exemplified in many ways in\u000amany novels of this century.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER III.\u000a\u000aON COURTSHIP, AND THE MANIFESTATION OF THE FEELINGS BY OUTWARD SIGNS AND\u000aDEEDS.\u000a\u000a\u000aA poor man possessed of good qualities, a man born of a low family\u000apossessed of mediocre qualities, a neighbour possessed of wealth, and\u000aone under the control of his father, mother or brothers, should not\u000amarry without endeavouring to gain over the girl from her childhood to\u000alove and esteem them. Thus a boy separated from his parents, and living\u000ain the house of his uncle, should try to gain over the daughter of his\u000auncle, or some other girl, even though she be previously betrothed to\u000aanother. And this way of gaining over a girl, says Ghotakamukha, is\u000aunexceptional, because Dharma can be accomplished by means of it, as\u000awell as by any other way of marriage.\u000a\u000aWhen a boy has thus begun to woo the girl he loves, he should spend his\u000atime with her and amuse her with various games and diversions fitted for\u000atheir age and acquaintanceship, such as picking and collecting flowers,\u000amaking garlands of flowers, playing the parts of members of a fictitious\u000afamily, cooking food, playing with dice, playing with cards, the game of\u000aodd and even, the game of finding out the middle finger, the game of six\u000apebbles, and such other games as may be prevalent in the country, and\u000aagreeable to the disposition of the girl. In addition to this, he should\u000acarry on various amusing games played by several persons together, such\u000aas hide and seek, playing with seeds, hiding things in several small\u000aheaps of wheat and looking for them, blind-man's buff, gymnastic\u000aexercises, and other games of the same sort, in company with the girl,\u000aher friends and female attendants. The man should also show great\u000akindness to any woman whom the girl thinks fit to be trusted, and should\u000aalso make new acquaintances, but above all he should attach to himself\u000aby kindness and little services the daughter of the girl's nurse, for\u000aif she be gained over, even though she comes to know of his design, she\u000adoes not cause any obstruction, but is sometimes even able to effect an\u000aunion between him and the girl. And though she knows the true character\u000aof the man, she always talks of his many excellent qualities to the\u000aparents and relations of the girl, even though she may not be desired to\u000ado so by him.\u000a\u000aIn this way the man should do whatever the girl takes most delight in,\u000aand he should get for her whatever she may have a desire to possess.\u000aThus he should procure for her such playthings as may be hardly known to\u000aother girls. He may also show her a ball dyed with various colours, and\u000aother curiosities of the same sort; and should give her dolls made of\u000acloth, wood, buffalo-horn, ivory, wax, flour, or earth; also utensils\u000afor cooking food, and figures in wood, such as a man and woman standing,\u000aa pair of rams, or goats, or sheep; also temples made of earth, bamboo,\u000aor wood, dedicated to various goddesses; and cages for parrots, cuckoos,\u000astarlings, quails, cocks, and partridges; water-vessels of different\u000asorts and of elegant forms, machines for throwing water about, guitars,\u000astands for putting images upon, stools, lac, red arsenic, yellow\u000aointment, vermilion and collyrium, as well as sandal-wood, saffron,\u000abetel nut and betel leaves. Such things should be given at different\u000atimes whenever he gets a good opportunity of meeting her, and some of\u000athem should be given in private, and some in public, according to\u000acircumstances. In short, he should try in every way to make her look\u000aupon him as one who would do for her everything that she wanted to be\u000adone.\u000a\u000aIn the next place he should get her to meet him in some place privately,\u000aand should then tell her that the reason of his giving presents to her\u000ain secret was the fear that the parents of both of them might be\u000adispleased, and then he may add that the things which he had given her\u000ahad been much desired by other people. When her love begins to show\u000asigns of increasing he should relate to her agreeable stories if she\u000aexpresses a wish to hear such narratives. Or if she takes delight in\u000alegerdemain, he should amaze her by performing various tricks of\u000ajugglery; or if she feels a great curiosity to see a performance of the\u000avarious arts, he should show his own skill in them. When she is\u000adelighted with singing he should entertain her with music, and on\u000acertain days, and at the time of going together to moonlight fairs and\u000afestivals, and at the time of her return after being absent from home,\u000ahe should present her with bouquets of flowers, and with chaplets for\u000athe head, and with ear ornaments and rings, for these are the proper\u000aoccasions on which such things should be presented.\u000a\u000aHe should also teach the daughter of the girl's nurse all the sixty-four\u000ameans of pleasure practised by men, and under this pretext should also\u000ainform her of his great skill in the art of sexual enjoyment. All this\u000atime he should wear a fine dress, and make as good an appearance as\u000apossible, for young women love men who live with them, and who are\u000ahandsome, good looking and well dressed. As for the saying that though\u000awomen may fall in love, they still make no effort themselves to gain\u000aover the object of their affections, that is only a matter of idle talk.\u000a\u000aNow a girl always shows her love by outward signs and actions, such as\u000athe following:--She never looks the man in the face, and becomes abashed\u000awhen she is looked at by him; under some pretext or other she shows her\u000alimbs to him; she looks secretly at him though he has gone away from her\u000aside; hangs down her head when she is asked some question by him, and\u000aanswers in indistinct words and unfinished sentences, delights to be in\u000ahis company for a long time, speaks to her attendants in a peculiar tone\u000awith the hope of attracting his attention towards her when she is at a\u000adistance from him, does not wish to go from the place where he is, under\u000asome pretext or other she makes him look at different things, narrates\u000ato him tales and stories very slowly so that she may continue conversing\u000awith him for a long time, kisses and embraces before him a child sitting\u000ain her lap, draws ornamental marks on the foreheads of her female\u000aservants, performs sportive and graceful movements when her attendants\u000aspeak jestingly to her in the presence of her lover, confides in her\u000alover's friends, and respects and obeys them, shows kindness to his\u000aservants, converses with them, and engages them to do her work as if she\u000awere their mistress, and listens attentively to them when they tell\u000astories about her lover to somebody else, enters his house when induced\u000ato do so by the daughter of her nurse, and by her assistance manages to\u000aconverse and play with him, avoids being seen by her lover when she is\u000anot dressed and decorated, gives him by the hand of her female friend\u000aher ear ornament, ring, or garland of flowers that he may have asked to\u000asee, always wears anything that he may have presented to her, become\u000adejected when any other bridegroom is mentioned by her parents, and does\u000anot mix with those who may be of her party, or who may support his\u000aclaims.\u000a\u000aThere are also some verses on the subject as follows:--\u000a\u000aA man, who has seen and perceived the feelings of the girl towards him,\u000aand who has noticed the outward signs and movements by which those\u000afeelings are expressed, should do everything in his power to effect an\u000aunion with her. He should gain over a young girl by childlike sports, a\u000adamsel come of age by his skill in the arts, and a girl that loves him\u000aby having recourse to persons in whom she confides.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER IV.\u000a\u000aABOUT THINGS TO BE DONE ONLY BY THE MAN, AND THE ACQUISITION OF THE GIRL\u000aTHEREBY. ALSO WHAT IS TO BE DONE BY A GIRL TO GAIN OVER A MAN, AND\u000aSUBJECT HIM TO HER.\u000a\u000a\u000aNow when the girl begins to show her love by outward signs and motions,\u000aas described in the last chapter, the lover should try to gain her over\u000aentirely by various ways and means, such as the following:--\u000a\u000aWhen engaged with her in any game or sport he should intentionally hold\u000aher hand. He should practise upon her the various kinds of embraces,\u000asuch as the touching embrace, and others already described in a\u000apreceeding chapter (Part II. Chapter 2). He should show her a pair of\u000ahuman beings cut out of the leaf of a tree, and such like things, at\u000aintervals. When engaged in water sports, he should dive at a distance\u000afrom her, and come up close to her. He should show an increased liking\u000afor the new foliage of trees and such like things. He should describe to\u000aher the pangs he suffers on her account. He should relate to her the\u000abeautiful dream that he has had with reference to other women. At\u000aparties and assemblies of his caste he should sit near her, and touch\u000aher under some pretence or other, and having placed his foot upon her's,\u000ahe should slowly touch each of her toes, and press the ends of the\u000anails; if successful in this, he should get hold of her foot with his\u000ahand and repeat the same thing. He should also press a finger of her\u000ahand between his toes when she happens to be washing his feet; and\u000awhenever he gives anything to her or takes anything from her, he should\u000ashow her by his manner and look how much he loves her.\u000a\u000aHe should sprinkle upon her the water brought for rinsing his mouth; and\u000awhen alone with her in a lonely place, or in darkness, he should make\u000alove to her, and tell her the true state of his mind without distressing\u000aher in any way.\u000a\u000aWhenever he sits with her on the same seat or bed he should say to her,\u000a"I have something to tell you in private," and then, when she comes to\u000ahear it in a quiet place, he should express his love to her more by\u000amanner and signs than by words. When he comes to know the state of her\u000afeelings towards him he should pretend to be ill, and should make her\u000acome to his house to speak to him. There he should intentionally hold\u000aher hand and place it on his eyes and forehead, and under the pretence\u000aof preparing some medicine for him he should ask her to do work for his\u000asake in the following words: "This work must be done by you, and by\u000anobody else." When she wants to go away he should let her go, with an\u000aearnest request to come and see him again. This device of illness should\u000abe continued for three days and three nights. After this, when she\u000abegins coming to see him frequently, he should carry on long\u000aconversations with her, for, says Ghotakamukha, "though a man loves a\u000agirl ever so much, he never succeeds in winning her without a great deal\u000aof talking." At last, when the man finds the girl completely gained\u000aover, he may then begin to enjoy her. As for the saying that women grow\u000aless timid than usual during the evening, and in darkness, and are\u000adesirous of congress at those times, and do not oppose men then and\u000ashould only be enjoyed at these hours, it is a matter of talk only.\u000a\u000aWhen it is impossible for the man to carry on his endeavours alone, he\u000ashould, by means of the daughter of her nurse, or of a female friend in\u000awhom she confides, cause the girl to be brought to him without making\u000aknown to her his design, and he should then proceed with her in the\u000amanner above described. Or he should in the beginning send his own\u000afemale servant to live with the girl as her friend, and should then gain\u000aher over by her means.\u000a\u000aAt last, when he knows the state of her feelings by her outward manner\u000aand conduct towards him at religious ceremonies, marriage ceremonies,\u000afairs, festivals, theatres, public assemblies, and such like occasions,\u000ahe should begin to enjoy her when she is alone, for Vatsyayana lays it\u000adown, that women, when resorted to at proper times and in proper\u000aplaces, do not turn away from their lovers.\u000a\u000aWhen a girl, possessed of good qualities and well-bred, though born in a\u000ahumble family, or destitute of wealth, and not therefore desired by her\u000aequals, or an orphan girl, or one deprived of her parents, but observing\u000athe rules of her family and caste, should wish to bring about her own\u000amarriage when she comes of age, such a girl should endeavour to gain\u000aover a strong and good looking young man, or a person whom she thinks\u000awould marry her on account of the weakness of his mind, and even without\u000athe consent of his parents. She should do this by such means as would\u000aendear her to the said person, as well as by frequently seeing and\u000ameeting him. Her mother also should constantly cause them to meet by\u000ameans of her female friends, and the daughter of her nurse. The girl\u000aherself should try to get alone with her beloved in some quiet place,\u000aand at odd times should give him flowers, betel nut, betel leaves and\u000aperfumes. She should also show her skill in the practice of the arts, in\u000ashampooing, in scratching and in pressing with the nails. She should\u000aalso talk to him on the subjects he likes best, and discuss with him the\u000aways and means of gaining over and winning the affections of a girl.\u000a\u000aBut old authors say that although the girl loves the man ever so much,\u000ashe should not offer herself, or make the first overtures, for a girl\u000awho does this loses her dignity, and is liable to be scorned and\u000arejected. But when the man shows his wish to enjoy her, she should be\u000afavourable to him and should show no change in her demeanour when he\u000aembraces her, and should receive all the manifestations of his love as\u000aif she were ignorant of the state of his mind. But when he tries to kiss\u000aher she should oppose him; when he begs to be allowed to have sexual\u000aintercourse with her she should let him touch her private parts only and\u000awith considerable difficulty; and though importuned by him, she should\u000anot yield herself up to him as if of her own accord, but should resists\u000ahis attempts to have her. It is only, moreover, when she is certain that\u000ashe is truly loved, and that her lover is indeed devoted to her, and\u000awill not change his mind, that she should then give herself up to him,\u000aand persuade him to marry her quickly. After losing her virginity she\u000ashould tell her confidential friends about it.\u000a\u000aHere ends the efforts of a girl to gain over a man.\u000a\u000aThere are also some verses on the subject as follows: A girl who is much\u000asought after should marry the man that she likes, and whom she thinks\u000awould be obedient to her, and capable of giving her pleasure. But when\u000afrom the desire of wealth a girl is married by her parents to a rich man\u000awithout taking into consideration the character or looks of the\u000abridegroom, or when given to a man who has several wives, she never\u000abecomes attached to the man, even though he be endowed with good\u000aqualities, obedient to her will, active, strong, and healthy, and\u000aanxious to please her in every way.[49] A husband who is obedient but\u000ayet master of himself, though he be poor and not good looking, is better\u000athan one who is common to many women, even though he be handsome and\u000aattractive. The wives of rich men, where there are many wives, are not\u000agenerally attached to their husbands, and are not confidential with\u000athem, and even though they possess all the external enjoyments of life,\u000astill have recourse to other men. A man who is of a low mind, who has\u000afallen from his social position, and who is much given to travelling,\u000adoes not deserve to be married; neither does one who has many wives and\u000achildren, or one who is devoted to sport and gambling, and who comes to\u000ahis wife only when he likes. Of all the lovers of a girl he only is her\u000atrue husband who possesses the qualities that are liked by her, and such\u000aa husband only enjoys real superiority over her, because he is the\u000ahusband of love.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 49: There is a good deal of truth in the last few\u000aobservations. Woman is a monogamous animal, and loves but one, and likes\u000ato feel herself alone in the affections of one man, and cannot bear\u000arivals. It may also be taken as a general rule that women either married\u000ato, or kept by, rich men love them for their wealth, but not for\u000athemselves.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER V.\u000a\u000aON CERTAIN FORMS OF MARRIAGE[50]\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen a girl cannot meet her lover frequently in private, she should send\u000athe daughter of her nurse to him, it being understood that she has\u000aconfidence in her, and had previously gained her over to her interests.\u000aOn seeing the man, the daughter of the nurse should, in the course of\u000aconversation, describe to him the noble birth, the good disposition, the\u000abeauty, talent, skill, knowledge of human nature and affection of the\u000agirl in such a way as not to let him suppose that she has been sent by\u000athe girl, and should thus create affection for the girl in the heart of\u000athe man. To the girl also she should speak about the excellent qualities\u000aof the man, especially of those qualities which she knows are pleasing\u000ato the girl. She should, moreover, speak with disparagement of the other\u000alovers of the girl, and talk about the avarice and indiscretion of their\u000aparents, and the fickleness of their relations. She should also quote\u000asamples of many girls of ancient times, such as Sakuntala and others,\u000awho, having united themselves with lovers of their own caste and their\u000aown choice, were ever happy afterwards in their society. And she should\u000aalso tell of other girls who married into great families, and being\u000atroubled by rival wives, became wretched and miserable, and were finally\u000aabandoned. She should further speak of the good fortune, the continual\u000ahappiness, the chastity, obedience, and affection of the man, and if the\u000agirl gets amorous about him, she should endeavour to allay her shame[51]\u000aand her fear as well as her suspicions about any disaster that might\u000aresult from the marriage. In a word, she should act the whole part of a\u000afemale messenger by telling the girl all about the man's affection for\u000aher, the places he frequented, and the endeavours he made to meet her,\u000aand by frequently repeating, "It will be all right if the man will take\u000ayou away forcibly and unexpectedly."\u000a\u000a\u000a_The Forms of Marriage._\u000a\u000aWhen the girl is gained over, and acts openly with the man as his wife,\u000ahe should cause fire to be brought from the house of a Brahman, and\u000ahaving spread the Kusha grass upon the ground, and offered an oblation\u000ato the fire he should marry her according to the precepts of the\u000areligious law. After this he should inform his parents of the fact,\u000abecause it is the opinion of ancient authors that a marriage solemnly\u000acontracted in the presence of fire cannot afterwards be set aside.\u000a\u000aAfter the consummation of the marriage, the relations of the man should\u000agradually be made acquainted with the affair, and the relations of the\u000agirl should also be apprised of it in such a way that they may consent\u000ato the marriage, and overlook the manner in which it was brought about,\u000aand when this is done they should afterwards be reconciled by\u000aaffectionate presents and favourable conduct. In this manner the man\u000ashould marry the girl according to the Gandharva form of marriage.\u000a\u000aWhen the girl cannot make up her mind, or will not express her readiness\u000ato marry, the man should obtain her in any one of the following ways:--\u000a\u000a(1). On a fitting occasion, and under some excuse, he should by means of\u000aa female friend with whom he is well acquainted, and whom he can trust,\u000aand who also is well known to the girl's family, get the girl brought\u000aunexpectedly to his house, and he should then bring fire from the house\u000aof a Brahman, and proceed as before described.\u000a\u000a(2.) When the marriage of the girl with some other person draws near,\u000athe man should disparage the future husband to the utmost in the mind of\u000athe mother of the girl, and then having got the girl to come with her\u000amother's consent to a neighbouring house, he should bring fire from the\u000ahouse of a Brahman, and proceed as above.\u000a\u000a(3.) The man should become a great friend of the brother of the girl,\u000athe said brother being of the same age as himself, and addicted to\u000acourtesans, and to intrigues with the wives of other people, and should\u000agive him assistance in such matters, and also give him occasional\u000apresents. He should then tell him about his great love for his sister,\u000aas young men will sacrifice even their lives for the sake of those who\u000amay be of the same age, habits, and dispositions as themselves. After\u000athis the man should get the girl brought by means of her brother to some\u000asecure place, and having brought fire from the house of a Brahman,\u000ashould proceed as before.\u000a\u000a(4.) The man should on the occasion of festivals get the daughter of the\u000anurse to give the girl some intoxicating substance, and then cause her\u000ato be brought to some secure place under the pretence of some business,\u000aand there having enjoyed her before she recovers from her intoxication,\u000ashould bring fire from the house of a Brahman, and proceed as before.\u000a\u000a(5.) The man should, with the connivance of the daughter of the nurse,\u000acarry off the girl from her house while she is asleep, and then, having\u000aenjoyed her before she recovers from her sleep, should bring fire from\u000athe house of a Brahman, and proceed as before.\u000a\u000a(6.) When the girl goes to a garden, or to some village in the\u000aneighbourhood, the man should, with his friends, fall on her guards, and\u000ahaving killed them, or frightened them away, forcibly carry her off, and\u000aproceed as before.\u000a\u000aThere are verses on the subject as follows:--In all the forms of\u000amarriage given in this chapter of this work, the one that precedes is\u000abetter than the one that follows it, on account of its being more in\u000aaccordance with the commands of religion, and therefore it is only when\u000ait is impossible to carry the former into practice that the latter\u000ashould be resorted to. As the fruit of all good marriages is love, the\u000aGandharva[52] form of marriage is respected, even though it is formed\u000aunder unfavourable circumstances, because it fulfils the object sought\u000afor. Another cause of the respect accorded to the Gandharva form of\u000amarriage is, that it brings forth happiness, causes less trouble in its\u000aperformance than any other forms of marriage, and is above all the\u000aresult of previous love.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 50: These forms of marriage differ from the four kinds of\u000amarriage mentioned in Chapter I., and are only to be made use of when\u000athe girl is gained over in the way mentioned in Chapters III. and IV.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 51: About this, see a story on the fatal effects of love at\u000apage 114 of "Early Ideas; a Group of Hindoo Stories," collected and\u000acollated by Anaryan. W. H. Allen and Co., London, 1881.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 52: About the Gandharvavivaha form of marriage, see note to\u000apage 28 of Captain R. F. Burton's "Vickram and the Vampire; or Tales of\u000aHindu Devilry." Longman, Green & Co., London, 1870. This form of\u000amatrimony was recognised by the ancient Hindus, and is frequent in\u000abooks. It is a kind of Scotch Wedding--ultra-Caledonian--taking place by\u000amutual consent without any form or ceremony. The Gandharvas are heavenly\u000aminstrels of Indra's court, who are supposed to be witnesses.]\u000a\u000a=END OF PART III.=\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPART IV.\u000a\u000aABOUT A WIFE.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER I.\u000a\u000aON THE MANNER OF LIVING OF A VIRTUOUS WOMAN, AND OF HER BEHAVIOUR DURING\u000aTHE ABSENCE OF HER HUSBAND.\u000a\u000a\u000aA virtuous woman, who has affection for her husband, should act in\u000aconformity with his wishes as if he were a divine being, and with his\u000aconsent should take upon herself the whole care of his family. She\u000ashould keep the whole house well cleaned, and arrange flowers of various\u000akinds in different parts of it, and make the floor smooth and polished\u000aso as to give the whole a neat and becoming appearance. She should\u000asurround the house with a garden, and place ready in it all the\u000amaterials required for the morning, noon and even sacrifices. Moreover\u000ashe should herself revere the sanctuary of the Household Gods, for says\u000aGonardiya, "nothing so much attracts the heart of a householder to his\u000awife as a careful observance of the things mentioned above."\u000a\u000aTowards the parents, relations, friends, sisters, and servants of her\u000ahusband she should behave as they deserve. In the garden she should\u000aplant beds of green vegetables, bunches of the sugar cane, and clumps of\u000athe fig tree, the mustard plant, the parsley plant, the fennel plant,\u000aand the xanthochymus pictorius. Clusters of various flowers, such as the\u000atrapa bispinosa, the jasmine, the gasminum grandiflorum, the yellow\u000aamaranth, the wild jasmine, the tabernamontana coronaria, the\u000anadyaworta, the china rose and others, should likewise be planted,\u000atogether with the fragrant grass andropogon schænanthus, and the\u000afragrant root of the plant andropogon miricatus. She should also have\u000aseats and arbours made in the garden, in the middle of which a well,\u000atank, or pool should be dug.\u000a\u000aThe wife should always avoid the company of female beggars, female\u000abuddish mendicants, unchaste and roguish women, female fortune tellers\u000aand witches. As regards meals she should always consider what her\u000ahusband likes and dislikes, and what things are good for him, and what\u000aare injurious to him. When she hears the sounds of his footsteps coming\u000ahome she should at once get up, and be ready to do whatever he may\u000acommand her, and either order her female servant to wash his feet, or\u000awash them herself. When going anywhere with her husband, she should put\u000aon her ornaments, and without his consent she should not either give or\u000aaccept invitations, or attend marriages and sacrifices, or sit in the\u000acompany of female friends, or visit the temples of the Gods. And if she\u000awants to engage in any kind of games or sports, she should not do it\u000aagainst his will. In the same way she should always sit down after him,\u000aand get up before him, and should never awaken him when he is asleep.\u000aThe kitchen should be situated in a quiet and retired place, so as not\u000ato be accessible to strangers, and should always look clean.\u000a\u000aIn the event of any misconduct on the part of her husband, she should\u000anot blame him excessively though she be a little displeased. She should\u000anot use abusive language towards him, but rebuke him with conciliatory\u000awords, whether he be in the company of friends or alone. Moreover, she\u000ashould not be a scold, for says Gonardiya, "there is no cause of dislike\u000aon the part of a husband so great as this characteristic in a wife."\u000aLastly she should avoid bad expressions, sulky looks, speaking aside,\u000astanding in the doorway, and looking at passers-by, conversing in the\u000apleasure groves, and remaining in a lonely place for a long time; and\u000afinally she should always keep her body, her teeth, her hair, and\u000aeverything belonging to her tidy, sweet, and clean.\u000a\u000aWhen the wife wants to approach her husband in private her dress should\u000aconsist of many ornaments, various kinds of flowers, and a cloth\u000adecorated with different colours, and some sweet-smelling ointments or\u000aunguents. But her every-day dress should be composed of a thin,\u000aclose-textured cloth, a few ornaments and flowers, and a little scent,\u000anot too much. She should also observe the fasts and vows of her husband,\u000aand when he tries to prevent her doing this, she should persuade him to\u000alet her do it.\u000a\u000aAt appropriate times of the year, and when they happen to be cheap, she\u000ashould buy earth, bamboos, firewood, skins, and iron pots, as also salt\u000aand oil. Fragrant substances, vessels made of the fruit of the plant\u000awrightea antidysenterica, or oval leaved wrightea, medicines, and other\u000athings which are always wanted, should be obtained when required and\u000akept in a secret place of the house. The seeds of the radish, the\u000apotato, the common beet, the Indian wormwood, the mangoe, the cucumber,\u000athe egg plant, the kushmanda, the pumpkin gourd, the surana, the\u000abignonia indica, the sandal wood, the premna spinosa, the garlic plant,\u000athe onion, and other vegetables, should be bought and sown at the proper\u000aseasons.\u000a\u000aThe wife, moreover, should not tell to strangers the amount of her\u000awealth, nor the secrets which her husband has confided to her. She\u000ashould surpass all the women of her own rank in life in her cleverness,\u000aher appearance, her knowledge of cookery, her pride, and her manner of\u000aserving her husband. The expenditure of the year should be regulated by\u000athe profits. The milk that remains after the meals should be turned into\u000aghee or clarified butter. Oil and sugar should be prepared at home;\u000aspinning and weaving should also be done there; and a store of ropes and\u000acords, and barks of trees for twisting into ropes should be kept. She\u000ashould also attend to the pounding and cleaning of rice, using its small\u000agrain and chaff in some way or other. She should pay the salaries of the\u000aservants, look after the tilling of the fields, and keeping of the\u000aflocks and herds, superintend the making of vehicles, and take care of\u000athe rams, cocks, quails, parrots, starlings, cuckoos, peacocks, monkeys,\u000aand deer; and finally adjust the income and expenditure of the day. The\u000aworn-out clothes should be given to those servants who have done good\u000awork, in order to show them that their services have been appreciated,\u000aor they may be applied to some other use. The vessels in which wine is\u000aprepared, as well as those in which it is kept, should be carefully\u000alooked after, and put away at the proper time. All sales and purchases\u000ashould also be well attended to. The friends of her husband she should\u000awelcome by presenting them with flowers, ointment, incense, betel\u000aleaves, and betel nut. Her father-in-law and mother-in law she should\u000atreat as they deserve, always remaining dependant on their will, never\u000acontradicting them, speaking to them in few and not harsh words, not\u000alaughing loudly in their presence, and acting with their friends and\u000aenemies as with her own. In addition to the above she should not be\u000avain, or too much taken up with her enjoyments. She should be liberal\u000atowards her servants, and reward them on holidays and festivals; and not\u000agive away anything without first making it known to her husband.\u000a\u000aThus ends the manner of living of a virtuous woman.\u000a\u000aDuring the absence of her husband on a journey the virtuous woman should\u000awear only her auspicious ornaments, and observe the fasts in honour of\u000athe Gods. While anxious to hear the news of her husband, she should\u000astill look after her household affairs. She should sleep near the elder\u000awomen of the house, and make herself agreeable to them. She should look\u000aafter and keep in repair the things that are liked by her husband, and\u000acontinue the works that have been begun by him. To the abode of her\u000arelations she should not go except on occasions of joy and sorrow, and\u000athen she should go in her usual travelling dress, accompanied by her\u000ahusband's servants, and not remain there for a long time. The fasts and\u000afeasts should be observed with the consent of the elders of the house.\u000aThe resources should be increased by making purchases and sales\u000aaccording to the practice of the merchants, and by means of honest\u000aservants, superintended by herself. The income should be increased, and\u000athe expenditure diminished as much as possible. And when her husband\u000areturns from his journey, she should receive him at first in her\u000aordinary clothes, so that he may know in what way she has lived during\u000ahis absence, and should bring to him some presents, as also materials\u000afor the worship of the Deity.\u000a\u000aThus ends the part relating to the behaviour of a wife during the\u000aabsence of her husband on a journey.\u000a\u000aThere are also some verses on the subject as follows.\u000a\u000a"The wife, whether she be a woman of noble family, or a virgin widow[53]\u000are-married, or a concubine, should lead a chaste life, devoted to her\u000ahusband, and doing every thing for his welfare. Women acting thus,\u000aacquire Dharma, Artha, and Kama, obtain a high position, and generally\u000akeep their husbands devoted to them."\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 53: This probably refers to a girl married in her infancy, or\u000awhen very young, and whose husband had died before she arrived at the\u000aage of puberty. Infant marriages are still the common custom of the\u000aHindoos.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER II.\u000a\u000aON THE CONDUCT OF THE ELDER WIFE TOWARDS THE OTHER WIVES OF HER HUSBAND,\u000aAND ON THAT OF A YOUNGER WIFE TOWARDS THE ELDER ONES. ALSO ON THE\u000aCONDUCT OF A VIRGIN WIDOW RE-MARRIED; OF A WIFE DISLIKED BY HER HUSBAND;\u000aOF THE WOMEN IN THE KING'S HAREM; AND LASTLY ON THE CONDUCT OF A HUSBAND\u000aTOWARDS MANY WIVES.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe causes of re-marrying during the lifetime of the wife are as\u000afollows:\u000a\u000a(1). The folly or ill temper of the wife.\u000a\u000a(2). Her husband's dislike to her.\u000a\u000a(3). The want of offspring.\u000a\u000a(4). The continual birth of daughters.\u000a\u000a(5). The incontinence of the husband.\u000a\u000aFrom the very beginning the wife should endeavour to attract the heart\u000aof her husband, by showing to him continually her devotion, her good\u000atemper, and her wisdom. If however she bears him no children, she should\u000aherself tell her husband to marry another woman. And when the second\u000awife is married, and brought to the house, the first wife should give\u000aher a position superior to her own, and look upon her as a sister. In\u000athe morning the elder wife should forcibly make the younger one decorate\u000aherself in the presence of their husband, and should not mind all the\u000ahusband's favour being given to her. If the younger wife does anything\u000ato displease her husband the elder one should not neglect her, but\u000ashould always be ready to give her most careful advice, and should teach\u000aher to do various things in the presence of her husband. Her children\u000ashe should treat as her own, her attendants she should look upon with\u000amore regard, even than on her own servants, her friends she should\u000acherish with love and kindness, and her relations with great honour.\u000a\u000aWhen there are many other wives besides herself, the elder wife should\u000aassociate with the one who is immediately next to her in rank and age,\u000aand should instigate the wife who has recently enjoyed her husband's\u000afavour to quarrel with the present favourite. After this she should\u000asympathize with the former, and having collected all the other wives\u000atogether, should get them to denounce the favourite as a scheming and\u000awicked woman, without however committing herself in any way. If the\u000afavourite wife happens to quarrel with the husband, then the elder wife\u000ashould take her part and give her false encouragement, and thus cause\u000athe quarrel to be increased. If there be only a little quarrel between\u000athe two, the elder wife should do all she can to work it up into a large\u000aquarrel. But if after all this she finds the husband still continues to\u000alove his favourite wife she should then change her tactics, and\u000aendeavour to bring about a conciliation between them, so as to avoid her\u000ahusband's displeasure.\u000a\u000aThus ends the conduct of the elder wife.\u000a\u000aThe younger wife should regard the elder wife of her husband as her\u000amother, and should not give anything away, even to her own relations,\u000awithout her knowledge. She should tell her everything about herself, and\u000anot approach her husband without her permission. Whatever is told to her\u000aby the elder wife she should not reveal to others, and she should take\u000acare of the children of the senior even more than of her own. When alone\u000awith her husband she should serve him well, but should not tell him of\u000athe pain she suffers from the existence of a rival wife. She may also\u000aobtain secretly from her husband some marks of his particular regard for\u000aher, and may tell him that she lives only for him, and for the regard\u000athat he has for her. She should never reveal her love for her husband,\u000anor her husband's love for her to any person, either in pride or in\u000aanger, for a wife that reveals the secrets of her husband is despised by\u000ahim. As for seeking to obtain the regard of her husband, Gonardiya says,\u000athat it should always be done in private, for fear of the elder wife. If\u000athe elder wife be disliked by her husband, or be childless, she should\u000asympathize with her, and should ask her husband to do the same, but\u000ashould surpass her in leading the life of a chaste woman.\u000a\u000aThus ends the conduct of the younger wife towards the elder.\u000a\u000aA widow in poor circumstances, or of a weak nature, and who allies\u000aherself again to a man, is called a widow re-married.\u000a\u000aThe followers of Babhravya say that a virgin widow should not marry a\u000aperson whom she may be obliged to leave on account of his bad character,\u000aor of his being destitute of the excellent qualities of a man, she thus\u000abeing obliged to have recourse to another person. Gonardya is of opinion\u000athat as the cause of a widow's marrying again is her desire for\u000ahappiness, and as happiness is secured by the possession of excellent\u000aqualities in her husband, joined to love of enjoyment, it is better\u000atherefore to secure a person endowed with such qualities in the first\u000ainstance. Vatsyayana however thinks that a widow may marry any person\u000athat she likes, and that she thinks will suit her.\u000a\u000aAt the time of her marriage the widow should obtain from her husband the\u000amoney to pay the cost of drinking parties, and picnics with her\u000arelations, and of giving them and her friends kindly gifts and presents;\u000aor she may do these things at her own cost if she likes. In the same way\u000ashe may wear either her husband's ornaments or her own. As to the\u000apresents of affection mutually exchanged between the husband and herself\u000athere is no fixed rule about them. If she leaves her husband after\u000amarriage of her own accord, she should restore to him whatever he may\u000ahave given her, with the exception of the mutual presents. If however\u000ashe is driven out of the house by her husband she should not return\u000aanything to him.\u000a\u000aAfter her marriage she should live in the house of her husband like one\u000aof the chief members of the family, but should treat the other ladies of\u000athe family with kindness, the servants with generosity, and all the\u000afriends of the house with familiarity and good temper. She should show\u000athat she is better acquainted with the sixty-four arts than the other\u000aladies of the house, and in any quarrels with her husband she should not\u000arebuke him severely, but in private do everything that he wishes, and\u000amake use of the sixty-four ways of enjoyment. She should be obliging to\u000athe other wives of her husband, and to their children she should give\u000apresents, behave as their mistress, and make ornaments and play things\u000afor their use. In the friends and servants of her husband she should\u000aconfide more than in his other wives, and finally she should have a\u000aliking for drinking parties, going to picnics, attending fairs and\u000afestivals, and for carrying out all kinds of games and amusements.\u000a\u000aThus ends the conduct of a virgin widow re-married.\u000a\u000aA woman who is disliked by her husband, and annoyed and distressed by\u000ahis other wives, should associate with the wife who is liked most by her\u000ahusband, and who serves him more than the others, and should teach her\u000aall the arts with which she is acquainted. She should act as the nurse\u000aof her husband's children, and having gained over his friends to her\u000aside, should through them make him acquainted of her devotion to him. In\u000areligious ceremonies she should be a leader, as also in vows and fasts,\u000aand should not hold too good an opinion of herself. When her husband is\u000alying on his bed she should only go near him when it is agreeable to\u000ahim, and should never rebuke him, or show obstinacy in any way. If her\u000ahusband happens to quarrel with any of his other wives, she should\u000areconcile them to each other, and if he desires to see any woman\u000asecretly, she should manage to bring about the meeting between them. She\u000ashould moreover make herself acquainted with the weak points of her\u000ahusband's character, but always keep them secret, and on the whole\u000abehave herself in such an way as may lead him to look upon her as a good\u000aand devoted wife.\u000a\u000aHere ends the conduct of a wife disliked by her husband.\u000a\u000aThe above sections will show how all the women of the King's seraglio\u000aare to behave, and therefore we shall now speak separately only about\u000athe king.\u000a\u000aThe female attendants in the harem (called severally Kanchukiyas,[54]\u000aMahallarikas,[55] and Mahallikas,[56]) should bring flowers, ointments\u000aand clothes from the King's wives to the King, and he having received\u000athese things should give them as presents to the servants, along with\u000athe things worn by him the previous day. In the afternoon the King,\u000ahaving dressed and put on his ornaments, should interview the women of\u000athe harem, who should also be dressed and decorated with jewels. Then\u000ahaving given to each of them such a place and such respect as may suit\u000athe occasion and as they may deserve, he should carry on with them a\u000acheerful conversation. After that he should see such of his wives as may\u000abe virgin widows re-married, and after them the concubines and dancing\u000agirls. All of these should be visited in their own private rooms.\u000a\u000aWhen the King rises from his noonday sleep, the woman whose duty it is\u000ato inform the King regarding the wife who is to spend the night with him\u000ashould come to him accompanied by the female attendants of that wife\u000awhose turn may have arrived in the regular course, and of her who may\u000ahave been accidentally passed over as her turn arrived, and of her who\u000amay have been unwell at the time of her turn. These attendants should\u000aplace before the King the ointments and unguents sent by each of these\u000awives, marked with the seal of her ring, and their names and their\u000areasons for sending the ointments should be told to the King. After this\u000athe King accepts the ointment of one of them, who then is informed that\u000aher ointment has been accepted, and that her day has been settled.[57]\u000a\u000aAt festivals, singing parties and exhibitions, all the wives of the King\u000ashould be treated with respect and served with drinks.\u000a\u000aBut the women of the harem should not be allowed to go out alone,\u000aneither should any women outside the harem be allowed to enter it except\u000athose whose character is well known. And lastly the work which the\u000aKing's wives have to do should not be too fatiguing.\u000a\u000aThus ends the conduct of the King towards the women of the harem, and of\u000atheir own conduct.\u000a\u000aA man marrying many wives should act fairly towards them all. He should\u000aneither disregard nor pass over their faults, and should not reveal to\u000aone wife the love, passion, bodily blemishes, and confidential\u000areproaches of the other. No opportunity should be given to any one of\u000athem of speaking to him about their rivals, and if one of them should\u000abegin to speak ill of another, he should chide her and tell her that she\u000ahas exactly the same blemishes in her character. One of them he should\u000aplease by secret confidence, another by secret respect, and another by\u000asecret flattery, and he should please them all by going to gardens, by\u000aamusements, by presents, by honouring their relations, by telling them\u000asecrets, and lastly by loving unions. A young woman who is of a good\u000atemper, and who conducts herself according to the precepts of the Holy\u000aWrit, wins her husband's attachment, and obtains a superiority over her\u000arivals.\u000a\u000aThus ends the conduct of a husband towards many wives.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTES:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 54: A name given to the maid servants of the zenana of the\u000aKings in ancient times, on account of their always keeping their breasts\u000acovered with a cloth called Kanchuki. It was customary in the olden time\u000afor the maid servants to cover their breasts with a cloth, while the\u000aQueens kept their breasts uncovered. This custom is distinctly to be\u000aseen in the Ajunta cave paintings.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 55: The meaning of this word is a superior woman, so it would\u000aseem that a Mahallarika must be a person in authority over the maid\u000aservants of the house.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 56: This was also appertaining to the rank of women employed\u000ain the harem.

But as it happened sometimes that some of\u000athem lost their turns owing to the King's absence, or to their being\u000aunwell, then in such cases the women whose turns had been passed over,\u000aand those whose turns had come, used to have a sort of lottery, and the\u000aointment of all the claimants were sent to the King, who accepted the\u000aointment of one of them, and thus settled the question.]\u000a\u000a=END OF PART IV.=\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPART V.\u000a\u000aABOUT THE WIVES OF OTHER MEN.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER I.\u000a\u000aOF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MEN AND WOMEN.--THE REASONS WHY WOMEN REJECT\u000aTHE ADDRESSES OF MEN.--ABOUT MEN WHO HAVE SUCCESS WITH WOMEN, AND ABOUT\u000aWOMEN WHO ARE EASILY GAINED OVER.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe wives of other people may be resorted to on the occasions already\u000adescribed in Part I., Chapter 5, of this work, but the possibility of\u000atheir acquisition, their fitness for cohabitation, the danger to oneself\u000ain uniting with them, and the future effect of these unions, should\u000afirst of all be examined. A man may resort to the wife of another, for\u000athe purpose of saving his own life, when he perceives that his love for\u000aher proceeds from one degree of intensity to another. These degrees are\u000aten in number, and are distinguished by the following marks:\u000a\u000a1. Love of the eye.\u000a\u000a2. Attachment of the mind.\u000a\u000a3. Constant reflection.\u000a\u000a4. Destruction of sleep.\u000a\u000a5. Emaciation of the body.\u000a\u000a6. Turning away from objects of enjoyment.\u000a\u000a7. Removal of shame.\u000a\u000a8. Madness.\u000a\u000a9. Fainting.\u000a\u000a10. Death.\u000a\u000aAncient authors say that a man should know the disposition,\u000atruthfulness, purity, and will of a young woman, as also the intensity,\u000aor weakness of her passions, from the form of her body, and from her\u000acharacteristic marks and signs. But Vatsyayana is of opinion that the\u000aforms of bodies, and the characteristic marks or signs are but erring\u000atests of character, and that women should be judged by their conduct, by\u000athe outward expression of their thoughts, and by the movements of their\u000abodies.\u000a\u000aNow as a general rule Gonikaputra says that a woman falls in love with\u000aevery handsome man she sees, and so does every man at the sight of a\u000abeautiful woman, but frequently they do not take any further steps,\u000aowing to various considerations. In love the following circumstances are\u000apeculiar to the woman. She loves without regard to right or wrong,[58]\u000aand does not try to gain over a man simply for the attainment of some\u000aparticular purpose. Moreover, when a man first makes up to her she\u000anaturally shrinks from him, even though she may be willing to unite\u000aherself with him. But when the attempts to gain her are repeated and\u000arenewed, she at last consents. But with a man, even though he may have\u000abegun to love, he conquers his feelings from a regard for morality and\u000awisdom, and although his thoughts are often on the woman, he does not\u000ayield, even though an attempt be made to gain him over. He sometimes\u000amakes an attempt or effort to win the object of his affections, and\u000ahaving failed, he leaves her alone for the future. In the same way, when\u000aa woman is once gained, he often becomes indifferent about her. As for\u000athe saying that a man does not care for what is easily gained, and only\u000adesires a thing which cannot be obtained without difficulty, it is only\u000aa matter of talk.\u000a\u000aThe causes of a woman rejecting the addresses of a man are as follows:\u000a\u000a1. Affection for her husband.\u000a\u000a2. Desire of lawful progeny.\u000a\u000a3. Want of opportunity.\u000a\u000a4. Anger at being addressed by the man too familiarly.\u000a\u000a5. Difference in rank of life.\u000a\u000a6. Want of certainty on account of the man being devoted to travelling.\u000a\u000a7. Thinking that the man may be attached to some other person.\u000a\u000a8. Fear of the man's not keeping his intentions secret.\u000a\u000a9. Thinking that the man is too devoted to his friends, and has too\u000agreat a regard for them.\u000a\u000a10. The apprehension that he is not in earnest.\u000a\u000a11. Bashfulness on account of his being an illustrious man.\u000a\u000a12. Fear on account of his being powerful, or possessed of too impetuous\u000apassion, in the case of the deer woman.\u000a\u000a13. Bashfulness on account of his being too clever.\u000a\u000a14. The thought of having once lived with him on friendly terms only.\u000a\u000a15. Contempt of his want of knowledge of the world.\u000a\u000a16. Distrust of his low character.\u000a\u000a17. Disgust at his want of perception of her love for him.\u000a\u000a18. In the case of an elephant woman, the thought that he is a hare man,\u000aor a man of weak passion.\u000a\u000a19. Compassion lest any thing should befall him on account of his\u000apassion.\u000a\u000a20. Despair at her own imperfections.\u000a\u000a21. Fear of discovery.\u000a\u000a22. Disillusion at seeing his grey hair or shabby appearance.\u000a\u000a23. Fear that he may be employed by her husband to test her chastity.\u000a\u000a24. The thought that he has too much regard for morality.\u000a\u000aWhichever of the above causes a man may detect, he should endeavour to\u000aremove it from the very beginning. Thus, the bashfulness that may arise\u000afrom his greatness or his ability, he should remove by showing his great\u000alove and affection for her. The difficulty of the want of opportunity,\u000aor if his inaccessibility, he should remove by showing her some easy way\u000aof access. The excessive respect entertained by the woman for him should\u000abe removed by making himself very familiar. The difficulties that arise\u000afrom his being thought a low character he should remove by showing his\u000avalour and his wisdom; those that come from neglect by extra attention;\u000aand those that arise from fear by giving her proper encouragement.\u000a\u000aThe following are the men who generally obtain success with women.\u000a\u000a1. Men well versed in the science of love.\u000a\u000a2. Men skilled in telling stories.\u000a\u000a3. Men acquainted with women from their childhood.\u000a\u000a4. Men who have secured their confidence.\u000a\u000a5. Men who send presents to them.\u000a\u000a6. Men who talk well.\u000a\u000a7. Men who do things that they like.\u000a\u000a8.

Men who are desired by good women.\u000a\u000a12. Men who are united with their female friends.\u000a\u000a13. Men who are good looking.\u000a\u000a14. Men who have been brought up with them.\u000a\u000a15. Men who are their neighbours.\u000a\u000a16. Men who are devoted to sexual pleasures, even though these be their\u000aown servants.\u000a\u000a17. The lovers of the daughters of their nurse.\u000a\u000a18. Men who have been lately married.\u000a\u000a19. Men who like picnics and pleasure parties.\u000a\u000a20. Men who are liberal.\u000a\u000a21.

But Vatsyayana lays it\u000adown that whenever it is possible a man should always act himself in\u000athese matters, and it is only when such is impracticable, or impossible,\u000athat female messengers should be employed. As for the saying that women\u000awho act and talk boldly and freely are to be won by the personal efforts\u000aof the man, and that women who do not possess those qualities are to be\u000agot at by female messengers, it is only a matter of talk.\u000a\u000aNow when a man acts himself in the matter he should first of all make\u000athe acquaintance of the woman he loves in the following manner.\u000a\u000a1st. He should arrange to be seen by the woman either on a natural or\u000aspecial opportunity. A natural opportunity is when one of them goes to\u000athe house of the other, and a special opportunity is when they meet\u000aeither at the house of a friend, or a caste-fellow, or a minister, or a\u000aphysician, as also on the occasion of marriage ceremonies, sacrifices,\u000afestivals, funerals, and garden parties.\u000a\u000a2nd. When they do meet, the man should be careful to look at her in such\u000aa way as to cause the state of his mind to be made known to her; he\u000ashould pull about his moustache, make a sound with his nails, cause his\u000aown ornaments to tinkle, bite his lower lip, and make various other\u000asigns of that description. When she is looking at him he should speak\u000ato his friends about her and other women, and should show to her his\u000aliberality and his appreciation of enjoyments. When sitting by the side\u000aof a female friend he should yawn and twist his body, contract his\u000aeyebrows, speak very slowly as if he were weary, and listen to her\u000aindifferently. A conversation having two meanings should also be carried\u000aon with a child or some other person, apparently having regard to a\u000athird person, but really having reference to the woman he loves, and in\u000athis way his love should be made manifest under the pretext of referring\u000ato others rather than to herself. He should make marks that have\u000areference to her, on the earth with his nails, or with a stick, and\u000ashould embrace and kiss a child in her presence, and give it the mixture\u000aof betel nut and betel leaves with his tongue, and press its chin with\u000ahis fingers in a caressing way. All these things should be done at the\u000aproper time and in proper places.\u000a\u000a3rd. The man should fondle a child that may be sitting on her lap, and\u000agive it something to play with, and also take the same back again.\u000aConversation with respect to the child may also be held with her, and in\u000athis manner he should gradually become well acquainted with her, and he\u000ashould also make himself agreeable to her relations. Afterwards, this\u000aacquaintance should be made a pretext for visiting her house frequently,\u000aand on such occasions he should converse on the subject of love in her\u000aabsence, but within her hearing. As his intimacy with her increases he\u000ashould place in her charge some kind of deposit or trust, and take away\u000afrom it a small portion at a time; or he may give her some fragrant\u000asubstances, or betel nuts to be kept for him by her. After this he\u000ashould endeavour to make her well acquainted with his own wife, and get\u000athem to carry on confidential conversations, and to sit together in\u000alonely places. In order to see her frequently he should arrange that the\u000asame goldsmith, the same jeweller, the same basket maker, the same dyer,\u000aand the same washerman should be employed by the two families. And he\u000ashould also pay her long visits openly under the pretence of being\u000aengaged with her on business, and one business should lead to another,\u000aso as to keep up the intercourse between them. Whenever she wants\u000aanything, or is in need of money, or wishes to acquire skill in one of\u000athe arts, he should cause her to understand that he is willing and able\u000ato do anything that she wants, to give her money, or teach her one of\u000athe arts, all these things being quite within his ability and power. In\u000athe same way he should hold discussions with her in company with other\u000apeople, and they should talk of the doings and sayings of other persons,\u000aand examine different things, like jewellery, precious stones, etc. On\u000asuch occasions he should show her certain things with the values of\u000awhich she may be unacquainted, and if she begins to dispute with him\u000aabout the things or their value, he should not contradict her, but point\u000aout that he agrees with her in every way.\u000a\u000aThus ends the ways of making the acquaintance of the woman desired.\u000a\u000aNow after a girl has become acquainted with the man as above described,\u000aand has manifested her love to him by the various outward signs; and by\u000athe motions of her body, the man should make every effort to gain her\u000aover. But as girls are not acquainted with sexual union, they should be\u000atreated with the greatest delicacy, and the man should proceed with\u000aconsiderable caution, though in the case of other women, accustomed to\u000asexual intercourse, this is not necessary. When the intentions of the\u000agirl are known, and her bashfulness put aside, the man should begin to\u000amake use of her money, and an interchange of clothes, rings, and flowers\u000ashould be made. In this the man should take particular care that the\u000athings given by him are handsome and valuable. He should moreover\u000areceive from her a mixture of betel nut and betel leaves, and when he is\u000agoing to a party he should ask for the flower in her hair, or for the\u000aflower in her hand. If he himself gives her a flower it should be a\u000asweet smelling one, and marked with marks made by his nails or teeth.\u000aWith increasing assiduity he should dispel her fears, and by degrees get\u000aher to go with him to some lonely place, and there he should embrace and\u000akiss her. And finally at the time of giving her some betel nut, or of\u000areceiving the same from her, or at the time of making an exchange of\u000aflowers, he should touch and press her private parts, thus bringing his\u000aefforts to a satisfactory conclusion.\u000a\u000aWhen a man is endeavouring to seduce one woman, he should not attempt to\u000aseduce any other at the same time. But after he had succeeded with the\u000afirst, and enjoyed her for a considerable time, he can keep her\u000aaffections by giving her presents that she likes, and then commence\u000amaking up to another woman. When a man sees the husband of a woman going\u000ato some place near his house, he should not enjoy the woman then, even\u000athough she may be easily gained over at that time. A wise man having a\u000aregard for his reputation should not think of seducing a woman who is\u000aapprehensive, timid, not to be trusted, well guarded, or possessed of a\u000afather-in-law, or mother-in-law.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER III.\u000a\u000aEXAMINATION OF THE STATE OF A WOMAN'S MIND.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen a man is trying to gain over a woman he should examine the state of\u000aher mind, and acts as follows.\u000a\u000aIf she listens to him, but does not manifest to him in any way her own\u000aintentions, he should then try to gain her over by means of a\u000ago-between.\u000a\u000aIf she meets him once, and again comes to meet him better dressed than\u000abefore, or comes to him in some lonely place, he should be certain that\u000ashe is capable of being enjoyed by the use of a little force. A woman\u000awho lets a man make up to her, but does not give herself up, even after\u000aa long time, should be considered as a trifler in love, but owing to the\u000afickleness of the human mind, even such a woman can be conquered by\u000aalways keeping up a close acquaintance with her.\u000a\u000aWhen a woman avoids the attentions of a man, and on account of respect\u000afor him, and pride in herself, will not meet him or approach him, she\u000acan be gained over with difficulty, either by endeavouring to keep on\u000afamiliar terms with her, or else by an exceedingly clever go-between.\u000a\u000aWhen a man makes up to a woman, and she reproaches him with harsh words,\u000ashe should be abandoned at once.\u000a\u000aWhen a woman reproaches a man, but at the same time acts affectionately\u000atowards him, she should be made love to in every way.\u000a\u000aA woman who meets a man in lonely places, and puts up with the touch of\u000ahis foot, but pretends, on account of the indecision of her mind, not to\u000abe aware of it, should be conquered by patience, and by continued\u000aefforts as follows:\u000a\u000aIf she happens to go to sleep in his vicinity he should put his left arm\u000around her, and see when she awakes whether she repulses him in reality,\u000aor only repulses him in such a way as if she were desirous of the same\u000athing being done to her again. And what is done by the arm can also be\u000adone by the foot. If the man succeeds in this point he should embrace\u000aher more closely, and if she will not stand the embrace and gets up, but\u000abehaves with him as usual the next day, he should consider then that she\u000ais not unwilling to be enjoyed by him. If however she does not appear\u000aagain, the man should try to get over her by means of a go-between; and\u000aif, after having disappeared for some time she again appears, and\u000abehaves with him as usual, the man should then consider that she would\u000anot object to be united with him.\u000a\u000aWhen a woman gives a man an opportunity, and makes her own love manifest\u000ato him, he should proceed to enjoy her. And the signs of a woman\u000amanifesting her love are these:\u000a\u000a1. She calls out to a man without being addressed by him in the first\u000ainstance.\u000a\u000a2. She shows herself to him in secret places.\u000a\u000a3. She speaks to him tremblingly and inarticulately.\u000a\u000a4. She has the fingers of her hand, and the toes of her feet moistened\u000awith perspiration, and her face blooming with delight.\u000a\u000a5. She occupies herself with shampooing his body and pressing his head.\u000a\u000a6. When shampooing him she works with one hand only, and with the other\u000ashe touches and embraces parts of his body.\u000a\u000a7. She remains with both hands placed on his body motionless as if she\u000ahad been surprised by something, or was overcome by fatigue.\u000a\u000a8. She sometimes bends down her face upon his thighs, and when asked to\u000ashampoo them does not manifest any unwillingness to do so.\u000a\u000a9. She places one of her hands quite motionless on his body, and even\u000athough the man should press it between two members of his body, she does\u000anot remove it for a long time.\u000a\u000a10. Lastly, when she has resisted all the efforts of the man to gain her\u000aover, she returns to him next day to shampoo his body as before.\u000a\u000aWhen a woman neither gives encouragement to a man, nor avoids him, but\u000ahides herself and remains in some lonely place, she must be got at by\u000ameans of the female servant who may be near her. If when called by the\u000aman she acts in the same way, then she should be gained over by means of\u000aa skilful go-between. But if she will have nothing to say to the man, he\u000ashould consider well about her before he begins any further attempts to\u000again her over.\u000a\u000aThus ends the examination of the state of a woman's mind.\u000a\u000aA man should first get himself introduced to a woman, and then carry on\u000aa conversation with her. He should give her hints of his love for her,\u000aand if he finds from her replies that she receives these hints\u000afavourably, he should then set to work to gain her over without any\u000afear. A woman who shows her love by outward signs to the man at his\u000afirst interview should be gained over very easily. In the same way a\u000alascivious woman, who when addressed in loving words replies openly in\u000awords expressive of her love, should be considered to have been gained\u000aover at that very moment. With regard to all women, whether they be\u000awise, simple, or confiding, this rule is laid down that those who make\u000aan open manifestation of their love are easily gained over.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER IV.\u000a\u000aABOUT THE BUSINESS OF A GO-BETWEEN.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf a woman has manifested her love or desire, either by signs or by\u000amotions of her body, and is afterwards rarely or never seen any where,\u000aor if a woman is met for the first time, the man should get a go-between\u000ato approach her.\u000a\u000aNow the go-between, having wheedled herself into the confidence of the\u000awoman by acting according to her disposition, should try to make her\u000ahate or despise her husband by holding artful conversations with her, by\u000atelling her about medicines for getting children, by talking to her\u000aabout other people, by tales of various kinds, by stories about the\u000awives of other men, and by praising her beauty, wisdom, generosity, and\u000agood nature, and then saying to her: "It is indeed a pity that you, who\u000aare so excellent a woman in every way, should be possessed of a husband\u000aof this kind. Beautiful lady, he is not fit even to serve you." The\u000ago-between should further talk to the woman about the weakness of the\u000apassion of her husband, his jealousy, his roguery, his ingratitude, his\u000aaversion to enjoyments, his dullness, his meanness, and all the other\u000afaults that he may have, and with which she may be acquainted. She\u000ashould particularly harp upon that fault or that failing by which the\u000awife may appear to be the most affected. If the wife be a deer woman,\u000aand the husband a hare man, then there would be no fault in that\u000adirection, but in the event of his being a hare man, and she a mare\u000awoman or elephant woman, then this fault should be pointed out to her.\u000a\u000aGonikaputra is of opinion that when it is the first affair of the woman,\u000aor when her love has only been very secretly shown, the man should then\u000asecure and send to her a go-between, with whom she may be already\u000aacquainted, and in whom she confides.\u000a\u000aBut to return to our subject. The go-between should tell the woman about\u000athe obedience and love of the man, and as her confidence and affection\u000aincrease, she should then explain to her the thing to be accomplished in\u000athe following way. "Hear this, Oh beautiful lady, that this man, born of\u000aa good family, having seen you, has gone mad on your account. The poor\u000ayoung man, who is tender by nature, has never been distressed in such a\u000away before, and it is highly probable that he will succumb under his\u000apresent affliction, and experience the pains of death." If the woman\u000alistens with a favourable ear, then on the following day the go-between,\u000ahaving observed marks of good spirits in her face, in her eyes, and in\u000aher manner of conversation, should again converse with her on the\u000asubject of the man, and should tell her the stories of Ahalya[59] and\u000aIndra, of Sakoontala[60] and Dushyanti, and such others as may be fitted\u000afor the occasion. She should also describe to her the strength of the\u000aman, his talents, his skill in the sixty-four sorts of enjoyments\u000amentioned by Babhravya, his good looks, and his liaison with some\u000apraiseworthy woman, no matter whether this last ever took place or not.\u000a\u000aIn addition to this, the go-between should carefully note the behaviour\u000aof the woman, which if favourable would be as follows: She would address\u000aher with a smiling look, would seat herself close beside her, and ask\u000aher, "Where have you been? What have you been doing? Where did you dine?\u000aWhere did you sleep? Where have you been sitting?" Moreover the woman\u000awould meet the go-between in lonely places and tell her stories there,\u000awould yawn contemplatively, draw long sighs, give her presents, remember\u000aher on occasions of festivals, dismiss her with a wish to see her again,\u000aand say to her jestingly, "Oh, well-speaking woman, why do you speak\u000athese bad words to me?" would discourse on the sin of her union with the\u000aman, would not tell her about any previous visits or conversations that\u000ashe may have had with him, but wish to be asked about these, and lastly\u000awould laugh at the man's desire, but would not reproach him in any way.\u000a\u000aThus ends the behaviour of the woman with the go-between.\u000a\u000aWhen the woman manifests her love in the manner above described, the\u000ago-between should increase it by bringing to her love tokens from the\u000aman. But if the woman be not acquainted with the man personally, the\u000ago-between should win her over by extolling and praising his good\u000aqualities, and by telling stories about his love for her. Here Auddalaka\u000asays that when a man or woman are not personally acquainted with each\u000aother, and have not shown each other any signs of affection, the\u000aemployment of a go-between is useless.\u000a\u000aThe followers of Babhravya on the other hand affirm that even though\u000athey be personally unacquainted, but have shown each other signs of\u000aaffection there is an occasion for the employment of a go-between.\u000aGonikaputra asserts that a go-between should be employed, provided they\u000aare acquainted with each other, even though no signs of affection may\u000ahave passed between them. Vatsyayana however lays it down that even\u000athough they may not be personally acquainted with each other, and may\u000anot have shown each other any signs of affection, still they are both\u000acapable of placing confidence in a go-between.\u000a\u000aNow the go-between should show the woman the presents, such as the betel\u000anut and betel leaves, the perfumes, the flowers, and the rings which the\u000aman may have given to her for the sake of the woman, and on these\u000apresents should be impressed the marks of the man's teeth, and nails,\u000aand other signs. On the cloth that he may send he should draw with\u000asaffron both his hands joined together as if in earnest entreaty.\u000a\u000aThe go-between should also show to the woman ornamental figures of\u000avarious kinds cut in leaves, together with ear ornaments, and chaplets\u000amade of flowers containing love letters expressive of the desire of the\u000aman,[61] and she should cause her to send affectionate presents to the\u000aman in return. After they have mutually accepted each other's presents,\u000athen a meeting should be arranged between them on the faith of the\u000ago-between.\u000a\u000aThe followers of Babhravya say that this meeting should take place at\u000athe time of going to the temple of a Deity, or on occasions of fairs,\u000agarden parties, theatrical performances, marriages, sacrifices,\u000afestivals and funerals, as also at the time of going to the river to\u000abathe, or at times of natural calamities,[62] fear of robbers or hostile\u000ainvasions of the country.\u000a\u000aGonikaputra is of opinion however that these meetings had better be\u000abrought about in the abodes of female friends, mendicants, astrologers,\u000aand ascetics. But Vatsyayana decides that that place is only well suited\u000afor the purpose which has proper means of ingress and egress, and where\u000aarrangements have been made to prevent any accidental occurrence, and\u000awhen a man who has once entered the house, can also leave it at the\u000aproper time without any disagreeable encounter.\u000a\u000aNow go-betweens or female messengers are of the following different\u000akinds, viz.:\u000a\u000a(1). A go-between who takes upon herself the whole burden of the\u000abusiness.\u000a\u000a(2). A go-between who does only a limited part of the business.\u000a\u000a(3). A go-between who is the bearer of a letter only.\u000a\u000a(4). A go-between acting on her own account.\u000a\u000a(5). The go-between of an innocent young woman.\u000a\u000a(6). A wife serving as a go-between.\u000a\u000a(7). A mute go-between.\u000a\u000a(8). A go-between who acts the part of the wind.\u000a\u000a(1). A woman who, having observed the mutual passion of a man and woman,\u000abrings them together and arranges it by the power of her own intellect,\u000asuch an one is called a go-between who takes upon herself the whole\u000aburden of the business. This kind of go-between is chiefly employed when\u000athe man and the woman are already acquainted with each other, and have\u000aconversed together, and in such cases she is sent not only by the man\u000a(as is always done in all other cases) but by the woman also.--The above\u000aname is also given to a go-between who, perceiving that the man and the\u000awoman are suited to each other, tries to bring about a union between\u000athem, even though they be not acquainted with each other.\u000a\u000a(2). A go-between who, perceiving that some part of the affair is\u000aalready done, or that the advances on the part of the man are already\u000amade, completes the rest of the business, is called a go-between who\u000aperforms only a limited part of the business.\u000a\u000a(3). A go-between, who simply carries messages between a man and a\u000awoman, who love each other, but who cannot frequently meet, is called\u000athe bearer of a letter or message.\u000a\u000aThis name is also given to one who is sent by either of the lovers to\u000aacquaint either the one or the other with the time and place of their\u000ameeting.\u000a\u000a(4). A woman who goes herself to a man, and tells him of her having\u000aenjoyed sexual union with him in a dream, and expresses her anger at his\u000awife having rebuked him for calling her by the name of her rival instead\u000aof by her own name, and gives him something bearing the marks of her\u000ateeth and nails, and informs him that she knew she was formerly desired\u000aby him, and asks him privately whether she or his wife is the best\u000alooking, such a person is called a woman who is a go-between for\u000aherself. Now such a woman should be met and interviewed by the man in\u000aprivate and secretly.\u000a\u000aThe above name is also given to a woman who having made an agreement\u000awith some other woman to act as her go-between, gains over the man to\u000aherself, by the means of making him personally acquainted with herself,\u000aand thus causes the other woman to fail. The same applies to a man who,\u000aacting as a go-between for another, and having no previous connection\u000awith the woman, gains her over for himself, and thus causes the failure\u000aof the other man.\u000a\u000a(5). A woman, who has gained the confidence of the innocent young wife\u000aof any man, and who has learned her secrets without exercising any\u000apressure on her mind, and found out from her how her husband behaves to\u000aher, if this woman then teaches her the art of securing his favour, and\u000adecorates her so as to show her love, and instructs her how and when to\u000abe angry, or to pretend to be so, and then, having herself made marks of\u000athe nails and teeth on the body of the wife, gets the latter to send for\u000aher husband to show these marks to him, and thus excite him for\u000aenjoyment, such is called the go-between of an innocent young woman. In\u000asuch cases the man should send replies to his wife through the same\u000awoman.\u000a\u000a(6). When a man gets his wife to gain the confidence of a woman whom he\u000awants to enjoy, and to call on her and talk to her about the wisdom and\u000aability of her husband, that wife is called a wife serving as a\u000ago-between. In this case the feelings of the woman with regard to the\u000aman should also be made known through the wife.\u000a\u000a(7). When any man sends a girl or a female servant to any woman under\u000asome pretext or other, and places a letter in her bouquet of flowers, or\u000ain her ear ornaments, or marks something about her with his teeth or\u000anails, that girl or female servant is called a mute go-between. In this\u000acase the man should expect an answer from the woman through the same\u000aperson.\u000a\u000a(8). A person, who carries a message to a woman, which has a double\u000ameaning, or which relates to some past transactions, or which is\u000aunintelligible to other people, is called a go-between who acts the part\u000aof the wind. In this case the reply should be asked for through the same\u000awoman.\u000a\u000aThus end the different kinds of go-betweens.\u000a\u000aA female astrologer, a female servant, a female beggar, or a female\u000aartist are well acquainted with the business of a go-between, and very\u000asoon gain the confidence of other women. Any one of them can raise\u000aenmity between any two persons if she wishes to do so, or extol the\u000aloveliness of any woman that she wishes to praise, or describe the arts\u000apractised by other women in sexual union. They can also speak highly of\u000athe love of a man, of his skill in sexual enjoyment, and of the desire\u000aof other women, more beautiful even than the woman they are addressing,\u000afor him, and explain the restraint under which he may be at home.\u000a\u000aLastly a go-between can, by the artfulness of her conversation unite a\u000awoman with a man, even though he may not have been thought of by her, or\u000amay have been considered beyond his aspirations. She can also bring back\u000aa man to a woman, who, owing to some cause or other, has separated\u000ahimself from her.\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 59: The wife of the sage Gautama, she was seduced by Indra the\u000aking of the Gods.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 60: The heroine of one of the best, if not the best, of Hindoo\u000aplays, and the best known in Sanscrit dramatic literature.

Persons in authority should not therefore do any\u000aimproper act in public, as such are impossible from their position, and\u000awould be deserving of censure. But if they find that such an act is\u000anecessary to be done, they should make use of the proper means as\u000adescribed in the following paragraphs.\u000a\u000aThe head man of the village, the King's officer employed there, and the\u000aman[63] whose business it is to glean corn, can gain over female\u000avillagers simply by asking them. It is on this account that this class\u000aof woman are called unchaste women by voluptuaries.\u000a\u000aThe union of the above mentioned men with this class of woman takes\u000aplace on the occasions of unpaid labour, of filling the granaries in\u000atheir houses, of taking things in and out of the house, of cleaning the\u000ahouses, of working in the fields, and of purchasing cotton, wool, flax,\u000ahemp, and thread, and at the season of the purchase, sale, and exchange\u000aof various other articles, as well as at the time of doing various other\u000aworks. In the same way the superintendents of cow pens enjoy the women\u000ain the cow pens; and the officers, who have the superintendence of\u000awidows, of the women who are without supporters, and of women who have\u000aleft their husbands, have sexual intercourse with these women. The\u000aintelligent accomplish their object by wandering at night in the\u000avillage, and while villagers also unite with the wives of their sons,\u000abeing much alone with them. Lastly the superintendents of markets have a\u000agreat deal to do with the female villagers at the time of their making\u000apurchases in the market.\u000a\u000aDuring the festival of the eighth moon, _i.e._, during the bright half\u000aof the month of Nargashirsha, as also during the moonlight festival of\u000athe month of Kartika, and the spring festival of Chaitra, the women of\u000acities and towns generally visit the women of the King's harem in the\u000aroyal palace. These visitors go to the several apartments of the women\u000aof the harem, as they are acquainted with them, and pass the night in\u000aconversation, and in proper sports, and amusement, and go away in the\u000amorning. On such occasions a female attendant of the King (previously\u000aacquainted with the woman whom the King desires), should loiter about,\u000aand accost this woman when she sets out to go home, and induce her to\u000acome and see the amusing things in the palace. Previous to these\u000afestivals even, she should have caused it to be intimated to this woman\u000athat on the occasion of this festival she would show her all the\u000ainteresting things in the royal palace. Accordingly she should show her\u000athe bower of the coral creeper, the garden house with its floor inlaid\u000awith precious stones, the bower of grapes, the building on the water,\u000athe secret passages in the walls of the palace, the pictures, the\u000asporting animals, the machines, the birds, and the cages of the lions\u000aand the tigers. After this, when alone with her, she should tell her\u000aabout the love of the King for her, and should describe to her the good\u000afortune which would attend upon her union with the King, giving her at\u000athe time a strict promise of secrecy. If the woman does not accept the\u000aoffer, she should conciliate and please her with handsome presents\u000abefitting the position of the King, and having accompanied her for some\u000adistance should dismiss her with great affection.\u000a\u000a(2). Or, having made the acquaintance of the husband of the woman whom\u000athe King desires, the wives of the King should get the wife to pay them\u000aa visit in the harem, and on this occasion a female attendant of the\u000aKing, having been sent thither, should act as above described.\u000a\u000a(3). Or, one of the King's wives should get acquainted with the woman\u000athat the King desires, by sending one of the female attendants to her,\u000awho should, on their becoming more intimate, induce her to come and see\u000athe royal abode. Afterwards, when she has visited the harem, and\u000aacquired confidence, a female confidante of the King, sent thither,\u000ashould act as before described.\u000a\u000a(4). Or, the King's wife should invite the woman, whom the King desires,\u000ato come to the royal palace, so that she might see the practice of the\u000aart in which the King's wife may be skilled, and after she has come to\u000athe harem, a female attendant of the King, sent thither, should act as\u000abefore described.\u000a\u000a(5). Or, a female beggar, in league with the King's wife, should say to\u000athe woman desired by the King, and whose husband may have lost his\u000awealth, or may have some cause of fear from the King: "This wife of the\u000aKing has influence over him, and she is, moreover, naturally\u000akind-hearted, we must therefore go to her in this matter. I shall\u000aarrange for your entrance into the harem, and she will do away with all\u000acause of danger and fear from the King." If the woman accepts this\u000aoffer, the female beggar should take her two or three times to the\u000aharem, and the King's wife there should give her a promise of\u000aprotection. After this, when the woman, delighted with her reception and\u000apromise of protection, again goes to the harem, then a female attendant\u000aof the King, sent thither, should act as directed.\u000a\u000a(6). What has been said above regarding the wife of one who has some\u000acause of fear from the King applies also to the wives of those who seek\u000aservice under the King, or who are oppressed by the King's ministers, or\u000awho are poor, or who are not satisfied with their position, or who are\u000adesirous of gaining the King's favour, or who wish to become famous\u000aamong the people, or who are oppressed by the members of their own\u000acaste, or who want to injure their caste fellows, or who are spies of\u000athe King, or who have any other object to attain.\u000a\u000a(7). Lastly, if the woman desired by the King be living with some person\u000awho is not her husband, then the King should cause her to be arrested,\u000aand having made her a slave, on account of her crime, should place her\u000ain the harem. Or the King should cause his ambassador to quarrel with\u000athe husband of the woman desired by him, and should then imprison her as\u000athe wife of an enemy of the King, and by this means should place her in\u000athe harem.\u000a\u000aThus end the means of gaining over the wives of others secretly.\u000a\u000aThe above mentioned ways of gaining over the wives of other men are\u000achiefly practised in the palaces of Kings. But a King should never enter\u000athe abode of another person, for Abhira,[64] the King of the Kottas was\u000akilled by a washerman while in the house of another, and in the same way\u000aJayasana the King of the Kashis was slain by the commandment of his\u000acavalry.\u000a\u000aBut according to the customs of some countries there are facilities for\u000aKings to make love to the wives of other men. Thus in the country of the\u000aAndras[65] the newly married daughters of the people thereof enter the\u000aKing's harem with some presents on the tenth day of their marriage, and\u000ahaving been enjoyed by the King are then dismissed. In the country of\u000athe Vatsagulmas[66] the wives of the chief ministers approach the King\u000aat night to serve him. In the country of the Vaidarbhas[67] the\u000abeautiful wives of the inhabitants pass a month in the King's harem\u000aunder the pretence of affection for the King. In the country of the\u000aAparatakas[68] the people gave their beautiful wives as presents to the\u000aministers and the Kings. And lastly in the country of the\u000aSaurashtras[69] the women of the city and the country enter the royal\u000aharem for the King's pleasure either together or separately.\u000a\u000aThere are also two verses on the subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"The above and other ways are the means employed in different countries\u000aby Kings with regard to the wives of other persons. But a King, who has\u000athe welfare of his people at heart, should not on any account put them\u000ainto practice."\u000a\u000a"A King who has conquered the six[70] enemies of mankind, becomes the\u000amaster of the whole earth."\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTES:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 63: This is a phrase used for a man who does the work of\u000aeverybody, and who is fed by the whole village.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 64: The exact date of the reign of these kings is not known.\u000aIt is supposed to have been about the beginning of the Christian era.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 65: The modern country of Tailangam, which is to the South of\u000aRajamundry.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 66: Supposed to be a tract of the country to the south of\u000aMalwa.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 67: Now known by the name of Berar.

For this\u000areason among themselves they give pleasure to each other in various ways\u000aas now described.\u000a\u000aHaving dressed the daughters of their nurses, or their female friends,\u000aor their female attendants, like men, they accomplish their object by\u000ameans of bulbs, roots, and fruits having the form of the Lingam, or they\u000alie down upon the statue of a male figure, in which the Lingam is\u000avisible and erect.\u000a\u000aSome Kings, who are compassionate, take or apply certain medicines to\u000aenable them to enjoy many wives in one night, simply for the purpose of\u000asatisfying the desire of their women, though they perhaps have no desire\u000aof their own. Others enjoy with great affection only those wives that\u000athey particularly like, while others only take them according as the\u000aturn of each wife arrives in due course. Such are the ways of enjoyment\u000aprevalent in Eastern countries, and what is said about the means of\u000aenjoyment of the female is also applicable to the male.\u000a\u000aBy means of their female attendants the ladies of the royal harem\u000agenerally get men into their apartments in the disguise or dress of\u000awomen. Their female attendants, and the daughters of their nurses, who\u000aare acquainted with their secrets, should exert themselves to get men to\u000acome to the harem in this way by telling them of the good fortune\u000aattending it, and by describing the facilities of entering and leaving\u000athe palace, the large size of the premises, the carelessness of the\u000asentinels, and the irregularities of the attendants about the persons of\u000athe royal wives. But these women should never induce a man to enter the\u000aharem by telling him falsehoods, for that would probably lead to his\u000adestruction.\u000a\u000aAs for the man himself, he had better not enter a royal harem, even\u000athough it may be easily accessible, on account of the numerous disasters\u000ato which he may be exposed there. If however he wants to enter it, he\u000ashould first ascertain whether there is an easy way to get out, whether\u000ait is closely surrounded by the pleasure garden, whether it has separate\u000aenclosures belonging to it, whether the sentinels are careless, whether\u000athe King has gone abroad, and then, when he is called by the women of\u000athe harem, he should carefully observe the localities, and enter by the\u000away pointed out by them. If he is able to manage it, he should hang\u000aabout the harem every day, and, under some pretext or other, make\u000afriends with the sentinels, and show himself attached to the female\u000aattendants of the harem, who may have become acquainted with his design,\u000aand to whom he should express his regret at not being able to obtain the\u000aobject of his desire. Lastly he should cause the whole business of a\u000ago-between to be done by the woman who may have access to the harem, and\u000ahe should be careful to be able to recognize the emissaries of the King.\u000a\u000aWhen a go-between has no access to the harem, then the man should stand\u000ain some place where the lady, whom he loves, and whom he is anxious to\u000aenjoy, can be seen.\u000a\u000aIf that place is occupied by the King's sentinels, he should then\u000adisguise himself as a female attendant of the lady who comes to the\u000aplace, or passes by it. When she looks at him he should let her know his\u000afeelings by outward signs and gestures, and should show her pictures,\u000athings with double meanings, chaplets of flowers, and rings. He should\u000acarefully mark the answer she gives, whether by word or by sign, or by\u000agesture, and should then try and get into the harem. If he is certain of\u000aher coming to some particular place he should conceal himself there, and\u000aat the appointed time should enter along with her as one of the guards.\u000aHe may also go in and out, concealed in a folded bed, or bed covering,\u000aor with his body made invisible,[71] by means of external applications,\u000aa receipt for one of which is as follows:\u000a\u000aThe heart of an ichneumon, the fruit of the long gourd (Tumbi), and the\u000aeyes of the serpent, should all be burnt without letting out the smoke,\u000athe ashes should then be ground and mixed in equal quantities with\u000awater. By putting this mixture upon the eyes a man can go about unseen.\u000a\u000aOther means of invisibility are prescribed by Duyana Brahmans and\u000aJogashiras.\u000a\u000aAgain the man may enter the harem during the festival of the eight moon\u000ain the month of Nargashirsha, and during the moonlight festivals when\u000athe female attendants of the harem are all busily occupied, or in\u000aconfusion.\u000a\u000aThe following principles are laid down on this subject.\u000a\u000aThe entrance of young men into harems, and their exit from them,\u000agenerally take place when things are being brought into the palace, or\u000awhen things are being taken out of it, or when drinking festivals are\u000agoing on, or when the female attendants are in a hurry, or when the\u000aresidence of some of the royal ladies is being changed, or when the\u000aKing's wives go to gardens, or to fairs, or when they enter the palace\u000aon their return from them; or, lastly, when the King is absent on a long\u000apilgrimage. The women of the royal harem know each other's secrets, and\u000ahaving but one object to attain, they give assistance to each other. A\u000ayoung man, who enjoys all of them, and who is common to them all, can\u000acontinue enjoying his union with them so long as it is kept quiet, and\u000ais not known abroad.\u000a\u000aNow in the country of the Aparatakas the royal ladies are not well\u000aprotected, and consequently many young men are passed into the harem by\u000athe women who have access to the royal palaces. The wives of the King of\u000athe Ahira country accomplish their objects with those sentinels in the\u000aharem who bear the name of Kashtriyas. The royal ladies in the country\u000aof the Vatsagulmas cause such men as are suitable to enter into the\u000aharem along with their female messengers. In the country of the\u000aVaidarbhas the sons of the royal ladies enter the royal harem when they\u000aplease, and enjoy the women, with the exception of their own mothers. In\u000athe Stri-rajya the wives of the King are enjoyed by his caste fellows\u000aand relations. In the Ganda country the royal wives are enjoyed by\u000aBrahmans, friends, servants, and slaves. In the Samdhava country,\u000aservants, foster children, and other persons like them enjoy the women\u000aof the harem. In the country of the Haimavatas adventurous citizens\u000abribe the sentinels and enter the harem. In the country of the Vanyas\u000aand the Kalmyas, Brahmans, with the knowledge of the King, enter the\u000aharem under the pretence of giving flowers to the ladies, and speak with\u000athem from behind a curtain, and from such conversation union afterwards\u000atakes place. Lastly, the women in the harem of the King of the Prachyas\u000aconceal one young man in the harem for every batch of nine or ten of the\u000awomen.\u000a\u000aThus act the wives of others.\u000a\u000aFor these reasons a man should guard his own wife. Old authors say that\u000aa King should select for sentinels in his harem such men as have their\u000afreedom from carnal desires well tested. But such men, though free\u000athemselves from carnal desire, by reason of their fear or avarice, may\u000acause other persons to enter the harem, and therefore Gonikaputra says,\u000athat Kings should place such men in the harem as may have had their\u000afreedom from carnal desires, their fears, and their avarice well tested.\u000aLastly, Vatsyayana says that under the influence of Dharma[72] people\u000amight be admitted, and therefore men should be selected who are free\u000afrom carnal desires, fear, avarice, and Dharma.[73]\u000a\u000aThe followers of Babhravya say that a man should cause his wife to\u000aassociate with a young woman who would tell him the secrets of other\u000apeople, and thus find out from her about his wife's chastity. But\u000aVatsyayana says, that as wicked persons are always successful with\u000awomen, a man should not cause his innocent wife to be corrupted by\u000abringing her into the company of a deceitful woman.\u000a\u000aThe following are the causes of the destruction of a woman's chastity:\u000a\u000aAlways going into society, and sitting in company.\u000a\u000aAbsence of restraint.\u000a\u000aThe loose habits of her husband.\u000a\u000aWant of caution in her relations with other men.\u000a\u000aContinued and long absence of her husband.\u000a\u000aLiving in a foreign country.\u000a\u000aDestruction of her love and feelings by her husband.\u000a\u000aThe company of loose women.\u000a\u000aThe jealousy of her husband.\u000a\u000aThere are also the following verses on the subject.\u000a\u000a"A clever man, learning from the Shastras the ways of winning over the\u000awives of other people, is never deceived in the case of his own wives.\u000aNo one, however, should make use of these ways for seducing the wives of\u000aothers, because they do not always succeed, and, moreover, often cause\u000adisasters, and the destruction of Dharma and Artha. This book, which is\u000aintended for the good of the people, and to teach them the ways of\u000aguarding their own wives, should not be made use of merely for gaining\u000aover the wives of others."\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTES:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 71: The way to make oneself invisible; the knowledge of the\u000aart of transmigration, or changing ourselves or others into any shape or\u000aform by the use of charms and spells; the power of being in two places\u000aat once, and other occult sciences are frequently referred to in all\u000aOriental literature.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 72: This may be considered as meaning religious influence, and\u000aalludes to persons who may be gained over by that means.]\u000a\u000a[Footnote 73: It may be noted from the above remarks that eunuchs do not\u000aappear to have been employed in the King's harem in those days, though\u000athey seem to have been employed for other purposes.

Dattaka's\u000awork does not appear to be extant now, but this abridgement of it is\u000avery clever, and quite equal to any of the productions of Emile Zola,\u000aand other writers of the realistic school of to-day.\u000a\u000aAlthough a great deal has been written on the subject of the courtesan,\u000anowhere will be found a better description of her, of her belongings, of\u000aher ideas, and of the working of her mind, than is contained in the\u000afollowing pages.\u000a\u000aThe details of the domestic and social life of the early Hindoos would\u000anot be complete without mention of the courtesan, and Part VI. is\u000aentirely devoted to this subject. The Hindoos have ever had the good\u000asense to recognise courtesans as a part and portion of human society,\u000aand so long as they behaved themselves with decency and propriety, they\u000awere regarded with a certain respect. Anyhow, they have never been\u000atreated in the East with that brutality and contempt so common in the\u000aWest, while their education has always been of a superior kind to that\u000abestowed upon the rest of womankind in Oriental countries.\u000a\u000aIn the earlier days the well-educated Hindoo dancing girl and courtesan\u000adoubtless resembled the Hetera of the Greeks, and being educated and\u000aamusing, were far more acceptable as companions than the generality of\u000athe married or unmarried women of that period. At all times and in all\u000acountries, there has ever been a little rivalry between the chaste and\u000athe unchaste. But while some women are born courtesans, and follow the\u000ainstincts of their nature in every class of society, it has been truly\u000asaid by some authors that every woman has got an inkling of the\u000aprofession in her nature, and does her best, as a general rule, to make\u000aherself agreeable to the male sex.\u000a\u000aThe subtlety of women, their wonderful perceptive powers, their\u000aknowledge, and their intuitive appreciation of men and things, are all\u000ashown in the following pages, which may be looked upon as a concentrated\u000aessence that has been since worked up into detail by many writers in\u000aevery quarter of the globe.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER I.\u000a\u000aOF THE CAUSES OF A COURTESAN RESORTING TO MEN; OF THE MEANS OF ATTACHING\u000aTO HERSELF THE MAN DESIRED; AND OF THE KIND OF MAN THAT IT IS DESIRABLE\u000aTO BE ACQUAINTED WITH.\u000a\u000a\u000aBy having intercourse with men courtesans obtain sexual pleasure, as\u000awell as their own maintenance. Now when a courtesan takes up with a man\u000afrom love, the action is natural; but when she resorts to him for the\u000apurpose of getting money, her action is artificial or forced. Even in\u000athe latter case, however, she should conduct herself as if her love were\u000aindeed natural, because men repose their confidence on those women who\u000aapparently love them. In making known her love to the man she should\u000ashow an entire freedom from avarice, and for the sake of her future\u000acredit she should abstain from acquiring money from him by unlawful\u000ameans.\u000a\u000aA courtesan, well dressed and wearing her ornaments, should sit or stand\u000aat the door of her house, and without exposing herself too much, should\u000alook on the public road so as to be seen by the passers by, she being\u000alike an object on view for sale.[74] She should form friendships with\u000asuch persons as would enable her to separate men from other women, and\u000aattach them to herself, and repair her own misfortunes, to acquire\u000awealth, and to protect her from being bullied, or set upon by persons\u000awith whom she may have dealings of some kind or another.\u000a\u000aThese persons are:\u000a\u000aThe guards of the town, or the police.\u000a\u000aThe officers of the courts of justice.\u000a\u000aAstrologers.\u000a\u000aPowerful men, or men with interest.\u000a\u000aLearned men.\u000a\u000aTeachers of the sixty-four arts.\u000a\u000aPithamardas or confidants.\u000a\u000aVitas or parasites.\u000a\u000aVidushakas or jesters.\u000a\u000aFlower sellers.\u000a\u000aPerfumers.\u000a\u000aVendors of spirits.\u000a\u000aWashermen.\u000a\u000aBarbers.\u000a\u000aBeggars.\u000a\u000aAnd such other persons as may be found necessary for the particular\u000aobject to be acquired.\u000a\u000aThe following kinds of men may be taken up with simply for the purpose\u000aof getting their money.\u000a\u000aMen of independent income.\u000a\u000aYoung men.\u000a\u000aMen who are free from any ties.\u000a\u000aMen who hold places of authority under the King.\u000a\u000aMen who have secured their means of livelihood without difficulty.\u000a\u000aMen possessed of unfailing sources of income.\u000a\u000aMen who consider themselves handsome.\u000a\u000aMen who are always praising themselves.\u000a\u000aOne who is an eunuch, but wishes to be thought a man.\u000a\u000aOne who hates his equals.\u000a\u000aOne who is naturally liberal.\u000a\u000aOne who has influence with the King or his ministers.\u000a\u000aOne who is always fortunate.\u000a\u000aOne who is proud of his wealth.\u000a\u000aOne who disobeys the orders of his elders.\u000a\u000aOne upon whom the members of his caste keep an eye.\u000a\u000aThe only son whose father is wealthy.\u000a\u000aAn ascetic who is internally troubled with desire.\u000a\u000aA brave man.\u000a\u000aA physician of the King.\u000a\u000aPrevious acquaintance.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, those who are possessed of excellent qualities are to\u000abe resorted to for the sake of love, and fame. Such men are as follows:\u000a\u000aMen of high birth, learned, with a good knowledge of the world, and\u000adoing the proper things at the proper times, poets, good story tellers,\u000aeloquent men, energetic men, skilled in various arts, far-seeing into\u000athe future, possessed of great minds, full of perseverance, of a firm\u000adevotion, free from anger, liberal, affectionate to their parents, and\u000awith a liking for all social gatherings, skilled in completing verses\u000abegun by others and in various other sports, free from all disease,\u000apossessed of a perfect body, strong, and not addicted to drinking,\u000apowerful in sexual enjoyment, sociable, showing love towards women and\u000aattracting their hearts to himself, but not entirely devoted to them,\u000apossessed of independent means of livelihood, free from envy, and last\u000aof all free from suspicion.\u000a\u000aSuch are the good qualities of a man.\u000a\u000aThe woman also should have the following characteristics, viz.:\u000a\u000aShe should be possessed of beauty, and amiability, with auspicious body\u000amarks. She should have a liking for good qualities in other people, as\u000aalso a liking for wealth. She should take delight in sexual unions\u000aresulting from love, and should be of a firm mind, and of the same class\u000aas the man with regard to sexual enjoyment.\u000a\u000aShe should always be anxious to acquire and obtain experience and\u000aknowledge, be free from avarice, and always have a liking for social\u000agatherings, and for the arts.\u000a\u000aThe following are the ordinary qualities of all women, viz.:\u000a\u000aTo be possessed of intelligence, good disposition, and good manners; to\u000abe straightforward in behaviour, and to be grateful; to consider well\u000athe future before doing anything; to possess activity, to be of\u000aconsistent behaviour, and to have a knowledge of the proper times and\u000aplaces for doing things; to speak always without meanness, loud\u000alaughter, malignity, anger, avarice, dullness, or stupidity, to have a\u000aknowledge of the Kama Sutra, and to be skilled in all the arts connected\u000awith it.\u000a\u000aThe faults of the women are to be known by the absence of any of the\u000aabove mentioned good qualities.\u000a\u000aThe following kinds of men are not fit to be resorted to by courtesans,\u000aviz.:\u000a\u000aOne who is consumptive; one who is sickly; one whose mouth contains\u000aworms; one whose breath smells like human excrement; one whose wife is\u000adear to him; one who speaks harshly; one who is always suspicious; one\u000awho is avaricious; one who is pitiless; one who is a thief; one who is\u000aself-conceited; one who has a liking for sorcery; one who does not care\u000afor respect or disrespect; one who can be gained over even by his\u000aenemies by means of money; and lastly, one who is extremely bashful.\u000a\u000aAncient authors are of opinion that the causes of a courtesan resorting\u000ato men are love, fear, money, pleasure, returning some act of enmity,\u000acuriosity, sorrow, constant intercourse, Dharma, celebrity, compassion,\u000athe desire of having a friend, shame, the likeness of the man to some\u000abeloved person, the search after good fortune, the getting rid of the\u000alove of somebody else, the being of the same class as the man with\u000arespect to sexual union, living in the same place, constancy, and\u000apoverty. But Vatsyayana decides that desire of wealth, freedom from\u000amisfortune, and love, are the only causes that affect the union of\u000acourtesans with men.\u000a\u000aNow a courtesan should not sacrifice money to her love, because money is\u000athe chief thing to be attended to. But in cases of fear, etc., she\u000ashould pay regard to strength and other qualities. Moreover, even though\u000ashe be invited by any man to join him, she should not at once consent to\u000aan union, because men are apt to despise things which are easily\u000aacquired. On such occasions she should first send the shampooers, and\u000athe singers, and the jesters, who may be in her service, or, in their\u000aabsence the Pithamardas, or confidants, and others, to find out the\u000astate of his feelings, and the condition of his mind. By means of these\u000apersons she should ascertain whether the man is pure or impure,\u000aaffected, or the reverse, capable of attachment, or indifferent, liberal\u000aor niggardly; and if she finds him to her liking, she should then\u000aemploy the Vita and others to attach his mind to her.\u000a\u000aAccordingly, the Pithamarda should bring the man to her house, under the\u000apretence of seeing the fights of quails, cocks, and rams, of hearing the\u000amaina (a kind of starling) talk, or of seeing some other spectacle, or\u000athe practice of some art; or he may take the woman to the abode of the\u000aman. After this, when the man comes to her house the woman should give\u000ahim something capable of producing curiosity, and love in his heart,\u000asuch as an affectionate present, telling him that it was specially\u000adesigned for his use. She should also amuse him for a long time by\u000atelling him such stories, and doing such things as he may take most\u000adelight in. When he goes away she should frequently send to him a female\u000aattendant, skilled in carrying on a jesting conversation, and also a\u000asmall present at the same time. She should also sometimes go to him\u000aherself under the pretence of some business, and accompanied by the\u000aPithamarda.\u000a\u000aThus end the means of attaching to herself the man desired.\u000a\u000aThere are also some verses on the subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"When a lover comes to her abode, a courtesan should give him a mixture\u000aof betel leaves and betel nut, garlands of flowers, and perfumed\u000aointments, and, showing her skill in arts, should entertain him with a\u000along conversation. She should also give him some loving presents, and\u000amake an exchange of her own things with his, and at the same time should\u000ashow him her skill in sexual enjoyment. When a courtesan is thus united\u000awith her lover she should always delight him by affectionate gifts, by\u000aconversation, and by the application of tender means of enjoyment."\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 74: In England the lower classes of courtesans walk the\u000astreets; in India and other places in the East they sit at the windows,\u000aor at the doors of their houses.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER II.\u000a\u000aOF LIVING LIKE A WIFE.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen a courtesan is living as a wife with her lover, she should behave\u000alike a chaste woman, and do everything to his satisfaction. Her duty in\u000athis respect, in short, is, that she should give him pleasure, but\u000ashould not become attached to him, though behaving as if she were really\u000aattached.\u000a\u000aNow the following is the manner in which she is to conduct herself, so\u000aas to accomplish the above mentioned purpose. She should have a mother\u000adependent on her, one who should be represented as very harsh, and who\u000alooked upon money as her chief object in life. In the event of there\u000abeing no mother, then an old and confidential nurse should play the same\u000arole. The mother or nurse, on their part, should appear to be displeased\u000awith the lover, and forcibly take her away from him. The woman herself\u000ashould always show pretended anger, dejection, fear, and shame on this\u000aaccount, but should not disobey the mother or nurse at any time.\u000a\u000aShe should make out to the mother or nurse that the man is suffering\u000afrom bad health, and making this a pretext for going to see him, she\u000ashould go on that account. She is, moreover, to do the following things\u000afor the purpose of gaining the man's favour, viz.:\u000a\u000aSending her female attendant to bring the flowers used by him on the\u000aprevious day, in order that she may use them herself as a mark of\u000aaffection, also asking for the mixture of betel nut and leaves that have\u000aremained uneaten by him; expressing wonder at his knowledge of sexual\u000aintercourse, and the several means of enjoyment used by him; learning\u000afrom him the sixty-four kinds of pleasure mentioned by Babhravya;\u000acontinually practising the ways of enjoyment as taught by him, and\u000aaccording to his liking; keeping his secrets; telling him her own\u000adesires and secrets; concealing her anger; never neglecting him on the\u000abed when he turns his face towards her; touching any parts of his body\u000aaccording to his wish; kissing and embracing him when he is asleep;\u000alooking at him with apparent anxiety when he is wrapt in thought, or\u000athinking of some other subject than herself; showing neither complete\u000ashamelessness, nor excessive bashfulness when he meets her, or sees her\u000astanding on the terrace of her house from the public road; hating his\u000aenemies; loving those who are dear to him; showing a liking for that\u000awhich he likes; being in high or low spirits according to the state that\u000ahe is in himself; expressing a curiosity to see his wives; not\u000acontinuing her anger for a long time; suspecting even the marks and\u000awounds made by herself with her nails and teeth on his body to have been\u000amade by some other woman; keeping her love for him unexpressed by words,\u000abut showing it by deeds, and signs, and hints; remaining silent when he\u000ais asleep, intoxicated, or sick; being very attentive when he describes\u000ahis good actions, and reciting them afterwards to his praise and\u000abenefit; giving witty replies to him if he be sufficiently attached to\u000aher; listening to all his stories, except those that relate to her\u000arivals; expressing feelings of dejection and sorrow if he sighs, yawns,\u000aor falls down; pronouncing the words "live long" when he sneezes;\u000apretending to be ill, or to have the desire of pregnancy, when she feels\u000adejected; abstaining from praising the good qualities of any body else,\u000aand from censuring those who possess the same faults as her own man:\u000awearing anything that may have been given to her by him; abstaining from\u000aputting on her ornaments, and from taking food when he is in pain, sick,\u000alow-spirited, or suffering from misfortune, and condoling and lamenting\u000awith him over the same; wishing to accompany him if he happens to leave\u000athe country himself or if he be banished from it by the King; expressing\u000aa desire not to live after him; telling him that the whole object and\u000adesire of her life was to be united with him; offering previously\u000apromised sacrifices to the Deity when he acquires wealth, or has some\u000adesire fulfilled, or when he has recovered from some illness or disease;\u000aputting on ornaments every day; not acting too freely with him; reciting\u000ahis name and the name of his family in her songs; placing his hand on\u000aher loins, bosom and forehead, and falling asleep after feeling the\u000apleasure of his touch; sitting on his lap and falling asleep there;\u000awishing to have a child by him; desiring not to live longer than he\u000adoes; abstaining from revealing his secrets to others; dissuading him\u000afrom vows and fasts by saying "let the sin fall upon me;" keeping vows\u000aand fasts along with him when it is impossible to change his mind on the\u000asubject; telling him that vows and fasts are difficult to be observed,\u000aeven by herself, when she has any dispute with him about them; looking\u000aon her own wealth and his without any distinction; abstaining from going\u000ato public assemblies without him, and accompanying him when he desires\u000aher to do so; taking delight in using things previously used by him, and\u000ain eating food that he has left uneaten; venerating his family, his\u000adisposition, his skill in the arts, his learning, his caste, his\u000acomplexion, his native country, his friends, his good qualities, his\u000aage, and his sweet temper; asking him to sing, and to do other such like\u000athings, if able to do them; going to him without paying any regard to\u000afear, to cold, to heat, or to rain; saying with regard to the next world\u000athat he should be her lover even there; adapting her tastes, disposition\u000aand actions to his liking; abstaining from sorcery; disputing\u000acontinually with her mother on the subject of going to him, and, when\u000aforcibly taken by her mother to some other place, expressing her desire\u000ato die by taking poison, by starving herself to death, by stabbing\u000aherself with some weapon, or by hanging herself; and lastly assuring the\u000aman of her constancy and love by means of her agents, and receiving\u000amoney herself, but abstaining from any dispute with her mother with\u000aregard to pecuniary matters.\u000a\u000aWhen the man sets out on a journey, she should make him swear that he\u000awill return quickly, and in his absence should put aside her vows of\u000aworshipping the Deity, and should wear no ornaments except those that\u000aare lucky. If the time fixed for his return has passed, she should\u000aendeavour to ascertain the real time of his return from omens, from the\u000areports of the people, and from the positions of the planets, the moon\u000aand the stars. On occasions of amusement, and of auspicious dreams, she\u000ashould say "Let me be soon united to him." If, moreover, she feels\u000amelancholy, or sees any inauspicious omen, she should perform some rite\u000ato appease the Deity.\u000a\u000aWhen the man does return home she should worship the God Kama (_i.e._,\u000athe Indian Cupid), and offer oblations to other Deities, and having\u000acaused a pot filled with water to be brought by her friends, she should\u000aperform the worship in honour of the crow who eats the offerings which\u000awe make to the manes of deceased relations. After the first visit is\u000aover she should ask her lover also to perform certain rites, and this he\u000awill do if he is sufficiently attached to her.\u000a\u000aNow a man is said to be sufficiently attached to a woman when his love\u000ais disinterested; when he has the same object in view as his beloved\u000aone; when he is quite free from any suspicions on her account; and when\u000ahe is indifferent to money with regard to her.\u000a\u000aSuch is the manner of a courtesan living with a man like a wife, and set\u000aforth here for the sake of guidance from the rules of Dattaka. What is\u000anot laid down here should be practised according to the custom of the\u000apeople, and the nature of each individual man.\u000a\u000aThere are also two verses on the subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"The extent of the love of women is not known, even to those who are the\u000aobjects of their affection, on account of its subtlety, and on account\u000aof the avarice, and natural intelligence of womankind."\u000a\u000a"Women are hardly ever known in their true light, though they may love\u000amen, or become indifferent towards them; may give them delight, or\u000aabandon them; or may extract from them all the wealth that they may\u000apossess."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER III.\u000a\u000aOF THE MEANS OF GETTING MONEY. OF THE SIGNS OF THE CHANGE OF A LOVER'S\u000aFEELINGS, AND OF THE WAY TO GET RID OF HIM.\u000a\u000a\u000aMoney is got out of a lover in two ways, viz.:\u000a\u000aBy natural or lawful means, and by artifices. Old authors are of opinion\u000athat when a courtesan can get as much money as she wants from her lover,\u000ashe should not make use of artifice. But Vatsyayana lays down that\u000athough she may get some money from him by natural means, yet when she\u000amakes use of artifice he gives her doubly more, and therefore artifice\u000ashould be resorted to for the purpose of extorting money from him at all\u000aevents.\u000a\u000aNow the artifices to be used for getting money from her lover are as\u000afollows:\u000a\u000a1st. Taking money from him on different occasions, for the purpose of\u000apurchasing various articles, such as ornaments, food, drink, flowers,\u000aperfumes and cloths, and either not buying them, or getting from him\u000amore than their cost.\u000a\u000a2nd. Praising his intelligence to his face.\u000a\u000a3rd. Pretending to be obliged to make gifts on occasion of festivals\u000aconnected with vows, trees, gardens, temples, or tanks.[75]\u000a\u000a4th.

Alleging that her property has been destroyed by fire, by the\u000afalling of her house, or by the carelessness of her servants.\u000a\u000a6th. Pretending to have lost the ornaments of her lover along with her\u000aown.\u000a\u000a7th. Causing him to hear through other people of the expenses incurred\u000aby her in coming to see him.\u000a\u000a8th. Contracting debts for the sake of her lover.\u000a\u000a9th. Disputing with her mother on account of some expense incurred by\u000aher for her lover, and which was not approved of by her mother.\u000a\u000a10th. Not going to parties and festivities in the houses of her friends\u000afor the want of presents to make to them, she having previously informed\u000aher lover of the valuable presents given to her by these very friends.\u000a\u000a11th. Not performing certain festive rites under the pretence that she\u000ahas no money to perform them with.\u000a\u000a12th. Engaging artists to do something for her lover.\u000a\u000a13th. Entertaining physicians and ministers for the purpose of attaining\u000asome object.\u000a\u000a14th. Assisting friends and benefactors both on festive occasions, and\u000ain misfortune.\u000a\u000a15th. Performing household rites.\u000a\u000a16th. Having to pay the expenses of the ceremony of marriage of the son\u000aof a female friend.\u000a\u000a17th. Having to satisfy curious wishes during her state of pregnancy.\u000a\u000a18th. Pretending to be ill, and charging her cost of treatment.\u000a\u000a19th. Having to remove the troubles of a friend.\u000a\u000a20th. Selling some of her ornaments, so as to give her lover a present.\u000a\u000a21st. Pretending to sell some of her ornaments, furniture, or cooking\u000autensils to a trader, who has been already tutored how to behave in the\u000amatter.\u000a\u000a22nd. Having to buy cooking utensils of greater value than those of\u000aother people, so that they might be more easily distinguished, and not\u000achanged for others of an inferior description.\u000a\u000a23rd. Remembering the former favours of her lover, and causing them\u000aalways to be spoken of by her friends and followers.\u000a\u000a24th. Informing her lover of the great gains of other courtezans.\u000a\u000a25th. Describing before them, and in the presence of her lover, her own\u000agreat gains, and making them out to be greater even than theirs, though\u000asuch may not have been really the case.\u000a\u000a26th. Openly opposing her mother when she endeavours to persuade her to\u000atake up with men with whom she has been formerly acquainted, on account\u000aof the great gains to be got from them.\u000a\u000a27th. Lastly, pointing out to her lover the liberality of his rivals.\u000a\u000aThus end the ways and means of getting money.\u000a\u000a       *       *       *       *       *\u000a\u000aA woman should always know the state of the mind, of the feelings, and\u000aof the disposition of her lover towards her, from the changes of his\u000atemper, his manner, and the colour of his face.\u000a\u000aThe behaviour of a waning lover is as follows:\u000a\u000a1st. He gives the woman either less than is wanted, or something else\u000athan that which is asked for.\u000a\u000a2nd. He keeps her in hopes by promises.\u000a\u000a3rd. He pretends to do one thing, and does something else.\u000a\u000a4th. He does not fulfil her desires.\u000a\u000a5th. He forgets his promises, or does something else than that which he\u000ahas promised.\u000a\u000a6th. He speaks with his own servants in a mysterious way.\u000a\u000a7th. He sleeps in some other house under the pretence of having to do\u000asomething for a friend.\u000a\u000a8th. Lastly, he speaks in private with the attendants of a woman with\u000awhom he was formerly acquainted.\u000a\u000aNow when a courtesan finds that her lover's disposition towards her is\u000achanging, she should get possession of all his best things before he\u000abecomes aware of her intentions, and allow a supposed creditor to take\u000athem away forcibly from her in satisfaction of some pretended debt.\u000aAfter this, if the lover is rich, and has always behaved well towards\u000aher, she should ever treat him with respect; but if he is poor and\u000adestitute, she should get rid of him as if she had never been acquainted\u000awith him in any way before.\u000a\u000aThe means of getting rid of a lover are as follows:\u000a\u000a1st. Describing the habits and vices of the lover as disagreeable and\u000acensurable, with the sneer of the lip, and the stamp of the foot.\u000a\u000a2nd. Speaking on a subject with which he is not acquainted.\u000a\u000a3rd. Showing no admiration for his learning, and passing a censure upon\u000ait.\u000a\u000a4th. Putting down his pride.\u000a\u000a5th. Seeking the company of men who are superior to him in learning and\u000awisdom.\u000a\u000a6th. Showing a disregard for him on all occasions.\u000a\u000a7th. Censuring men possessed of the same faults as her lover.\u000a\u000a8th. Expressing dissatisfaction at the ways and means of enjoyment used\u000aby him.\u000a\u000a9th. Not giving him her mouth to kiss.\u000a\u000a10th. Refusing access to her Jaghana, _i.e._, the part of the body\u000abetween the navel and the thighs.\u000a\u000a11th. Showing a dislike for the wounds made by his nails and teeth.\u000a\u000a12th. Not pressing close up against him at the time when he embraces\u000aher.\u000a\u000a13th. Keeping her limbs without movement at the time of congress.\u000a\u000a14th. Desiring him to employ her when he is fatigued.\u000a\u000a15th. Laughing at his attachment to her.\u000a\u000a16th. Not responding to his embraces.\u000a\u000a17th. Turning away from him when he begins to embrace her.\u000a\u000a18th. Pretending to be sleepy.\u000a\u000a19th. Going out visiting, or into company, when she perceives his desire\u000ato enjoy her during the day time.\u000a\u000a20th. Mis-constructing his words.\u000a\u000a21st. Laughing without any joke, or at the time of any joke made by him,\u000alaughing under some pretence.\u000a\u000a22nd. Looking with side glances at her own attendants, and clapping her\u000ahands when he says anything.\u000a\u000a23rd. Interrupting him in the middle of his stories, and beginning to\u000atell other stories herself.\u000a\u000a24th. Reciting his faults and his vices, and declaring them to be\u000aincurable.\u000a\u000a25th. Saying words to her female attendants calculated to cut the heart\u000aof her lover to the quick.\u000a\u000a26th. Taking care not to look at him when he comes to her.\u000a\u000a27th. Asking him what cannot be granted.\u000a\u000a28th. And, after all, finally dismissing him.\u000a\u000aThere are also two verses on this subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"The duty of a courtesan consists in forming connections with suitable\u000amen after due and full consideration, and attaching the person with whom\u000ashe is united to herself; in obtaining wealth from the person who is\u000aattached to her, and then dismissing him after she has taken away all\u000ahis possessions."\u000a\u000a"A courtesan leading in this manner the life of a wife is not troubled\u000awith too many lovers, and yet obtains abundance of wealth."\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 75: On the completion of a vow a festival takes place. Some\u000atrees such as the Peepul and Banyan trees, are invested with sacred\u000athreads like the Brahman's, and on the occasion of this ceremony a\u000afestival is given. In the same way when gardens are made, and tanks or\u000atemples built, then also festivals are observed.]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER IV.\u000a\u000aABOUT RE-UNION WITH A FORMER LOVER.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen a courtesan abandons her present lover after all his wealth is\u000aexhausted, she may then consider about her re-union with a former lover.\u000aBut she should return to him only if he has acquired fresh wealth, or is\u000astill wealthy, and if he is still attached to her. And if this man be\u000aliving at the time with some other women she should consider well before\u000ashe acts.\u000a\u000aNow such a man can only be in one of the six following conditions, viz.:\u000a\u000a1st. He may have left the first woman of his own accord, and may even\u000ahave left another woman since then.\u000a\u000a2nd. He may have been driven away from both women.\u000a\u000a3rd. He may have left the one woman of his own accord, and be living\u000awith another woman.\u000a\u000a5th. He may have been driven away from the one woman, and left the other\u000aof his own accord.\u000a\u000a6th. He may have been driven away by the one woman, and may be living\u000awith another.\u000a\u000a(1). Now if the man has left both women of his own accord, he should not\u000abe resorted to, on account of the fickleness of his mind, and his\u000aindifference to the excellencies of both of them.\u000a\u000a(2). As regards the man who may have been driven away from both women,\u000aif he has been driven away from the last one because the woman could get\u000amore money from some other man, then he should be resorted to, for if\u000aattached to the first woman he would give her more money, through vanity\u000aand emulation to spite the other woman. But if he has been driven away\u000aby the woman on account of his poverty, or stinginess, he should not\u000athen be resorted to.\u000a\u000a(3). In the case of the man who may have left the one woman of his own\u000aaccord, and been driven away by the other, if he agrees to return to the\u000aformer and give her plenty of money beforehand, then he should be\u000aresorted to.\u000a\u000a(4). In the case of the man who may have left the one woman of his own\u000aaccord, and be living with another woman, the former (wishing to take up\u000awith him again) should first ascertain if he left her in the first\u000ainstance in the hope of finding some particular excellence in the other\u000awoman, and that not having found any such excellence, he was willing to\u000acome back to her, and to give her much money on account of his conduct,\u000aand on account of his affection still existing for her.\u000a\u000aOr, whether, having discovered many faults in the other woman, he would\u000anow see even more excellences in herself than actually exist, and would\u000abe prepared to give her much money for these qualities.\u000a\u000aOr, lastly, to consider whether he was a weak man, or a man fond of\u000aenjoying many women, or one who liked a poor woman, or one who never did\u000aanything for the woman that he was with. After maturely considering all\u000athese things, she should resort to him or not, according to\u000acircumstances.\u000a\u000a(5). As regards the man who may have been driven away from the one\u000awoman, and left the other of his own accord, the former woman (wishing\u000ato re-unite with him) should first ascertain whether he still has any\u000aaffection for her, and would consequently spend much money upon her; or\u000awhether, being attached to her excellent qualities, he did not take\u000adelight in any other women; or whether, being driven away from her\u000aformerly before completely satisfying his sexual desires, he wished to\u000aget back to her, so as to be revenged for the injury done to him; or\u000awhether he wished to create confidence in her mind, and then take back\u000afrom her the wealth which she formerly took from him, and finally\u000adestroy her; or, lastly, whether he wished first to separate her from\u000aher present lover, and then to break away from her himself. If, after\u000aconsidering all these things, she is of opinion that his intentions are\u000areally pure and honest, she can re-unite herself with him. But if his\u000amind be at all tainted with evil intentions, he should be avoided.\u000a\u000a(6). In the case of the man who may have been driven away by one\u000awoman, and be living with another, if the man makes overtures in return\u000ato the first one, the courtesan should consider well before she acts,\u000aand while the other woman is engaged in attracting him to herself, she\u000ashould try in her turn (through keeping herself behind the scenes) to\u000again him over, on the grounds of any of the following considerations,\u000aviz.:\u000a\u000a1st. That he was driven away unjustly and for no proper reason, and now\u000athat he has gone to another woman, every effort must be used to bring\u000ahim back to myself.\u000a\u000a2nd. That if he were once to converse with me again, he would break away\u000afrom the other woman.\u000a\u000a3rd. That the pride of my present lover would be put down by means of\u000athe former one.\u000a\u000a4th. That he has become wealthy, has secured a higher position, and\u000aholds a place of authority under the King.\u000a\u000a5th. That he is separate from his wife.\u000a\u000a6th. That he is now independent.\u000a\u000a7th. That he lives apart from his father, or brother.\u000a\u000a8th. That by making peace with him I shall be able to get hold of a very\u000arich man, who is now prevented from coming to me by my present lover.\u000a\u000a9th. That as he is not respected by his wife, I shall now be able to\u000aseparate him from her.\u000a\u000a10th. That the friend of this man loves my rival, who hates me\u000acordially; I shall, therefore, by this means separate the friend from\u000ahis mistress.\u000a\u000a11th. And lastly, I shall bring discredit upon him by bringing him back\u000ato me, thus showing the fickleness of his mind.\u000a\u000aWhen a courtesan is resolved to take up again with a former lover, her\u000aPithamurda and other servants should tell him that his former expulsion\u000afrom the woman's house was caused by the wickedness of her mother; that\u000athe woman loved him just as much as ever at that time, but could not\u000ahelp the occurrence on account of her deference to her mother's will;\u000athat she hated the union of her present lover, and disliked him\u000aexcessively. In addition to this, they should create confidence in his\u000amind by speaking to him of her former love for him, and should allude to\u000athe mark of that love that she has ever remembered. This mark of her\u000alove should be connected with some kind of pleasure that may have been\u000apractised by him, such as his way of kissing her, or manner of having\u000aconnection with her.\u000a\u000aThus end the ways of bringing about a re-union with a former lover.\u000a\u000aWhen a woman has to choose between two lovers, one of whom was formerly\u000aunited with her, while the other is a stranger, the Acharyas (sages) are\u000aof opinion that the first one is preferable, because his disposition and\u000acharacter being already known by previous careful observation, he can be\u000aeasily pleased and satisfied; but Vatsyayana thinks that a former lover,\u000ahaving already spent a great deal of his wealth, is not able or willing\u000ato give much money again, and is not, therefore, to be relied upon so\u000amuch as a stranger. Particular cases may, however, arise differing from\u000athis general rule on account of the different natures of men.\u000a\u000aThere are also verses on the subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"Re-union with a former lover may be desirable so as to separate some\u000aparticular woman from some particular man, or some particular man from\u000asome particular woman, or to have a certain effect upon the present\u000alover."\u000a\u000a"When a man is excessively attached to a woman, he is afraid of her\u000acoming into contact with other men; he does not then regard or notice\u000aher faults; and he gives her much wealth through fear of her leaving\u000ahim."\u000a\u000a"A courtesan should be agreeable to the man who is attached to her, and\u000adespise the man who does not care for her. If while she is living with\u000aone man a messenger comes to her from some other man, she may either\u000arefuse to listen to any negotiations on his part, or appoint a fixed\u000atime for him to visit her, but she should not leave the man who may be\u000aliving with her and who may be attached to her."\u000a\u000a"A wise woman should only renew her connection with a former lover if\u000ashe is satisfied that good fortune, gain, love, and friendship, are\u000alikely to be the result of such a re-union."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER V.\u000a\u000aOF DIFFERENT KINDS OF GAIN.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen a courtesan is able to realize much money every day, by reason of\u000amany customers, she should not confine herself to a single lover; under\u000asuch circumstances, she should fix her rate for one night, after\u000aconsidering the place, the season, and the condition of the people, and\u000ahaving regard to her own good qualities and good looks, and after\u000acomparing her rates with those of other courtesans. She can inform her\u000alovers, and friends, and acquaintances about these charges. If, however,\u000ashe can obtain a great gain from a single lover, she may resort to him\u000aalone, and live with him like a wife.\u000a\u000aNow, the Sages are of opinion that when a courtesan has the chance of an\u000aequal gain from two lovers at the same time, a preference should be\u000agiven to the one who would give her the kind of thing which she wants.\u000aBut Vatsyayana says that the preference should be given to the one who\u000agives her gold, because it cannot be taken back like some other things,\u000ait can be easily received, and is also the means of procuring anything\u000athat may be wished for. Of such things as gold, silver, copper, bell\u000ametal, iron, pots, furniture, beds, upper garments, under vestments,\u000afragrant substances, vessels made of gourds, ghee, oil, corn, cattle,\u000aand other things of a like nature, the first, viz., gold, is superior to\u000aall the others.\u000a\u000aWhen the same labour is required to gain any two lovers, or when the\u000asame kind of thing is to be got from each of them, the choice should be\u000amade by the advice of a friend, or it may be made from their personal\u000aqualities, or from the signs of good or bad fortune that may be\u000aconnected with them.\u000a\u000aWhen there are two lovers, one of whom is attached to the courtesan, and\u000athe other is simply very generous, the Sages say that the preference\u000ashould be given to the generous lover, but Vatsyayana is of opinion that\u000athe one who is really attached to the courtesan should be preferred,\u000abecause he can be made to be generous, even as a miser gives money if he\u000abecomes fond of a woman, but a man who is simply generous cannot be made\u000ato love with real attachment. But among those who are attached to her,\u000aif there is one who is poor, and one who is rich, the preference is of\u000acourse to be given to the latter.\u000a\u000aWhen there are two lovers, one of whom is generous, and the other ready\u000ato do any service for the courtesan, some Sages say that the one who is\u000aready to do the service should be preferred, but Vatsyayana is of\u000aopinion that a man who does a service thinks that he has gained his\u000aobject when he has done something once, but a generous man does not care\u000afor what he has given before. Even here the choice should be guided by\u000athe likelihood of the future good to be derived from her union with\u000aeither of them.\u000a\u000aWhen one of the two lovers is grateful, and the other liberal, some\u000aSages say that the liberal one should be preferred, but Vatsyayana is of\u000aopinion that the former should be chosen, because liberal men are\u000agenerally haughty, plain spoken, and wanting in consideration towards\u000aothers. Even though these liberal men have been on friendly terms for a\u000along time, yet if they see any fault in the courtesan, or are told lies\u000aabout her by some other women, they do not care for past services, but\u000aleave abruptly. On the other hand the grateful man does not at once\u000abreak off from her, on account of a regard for the pains she may have\u000ataken to please him. In this case also the choice is to be guided with\u000arespect to what may happen in future.\u000a\u000aWhen an occasion for complying with the request of a friend, and a\u000achance of getting money come together, the Sages say that the chance of\u000agetting money should be preferred. But Vatsyayana thinks that the money\u000acan be obtained to-morrow as well as to-day, but if the request of a\u000afriend be not at once complied with, he may become disaffected. Even\u000ahere, in making the choice, regard must be paid to future good fortune.\u000a\u000aOn such an occasion, however, the courtesan might pacify her friend by\u000apretending to have some work to do, and telling him that his request\u000awill be complied with next day, and in this way secure the chance of\u000agetting the money that has been offered her.\u000a\u000aWhen the chance of getting money, and the chance of avoiding some\u000adisaster come at the same time, the Sages are of opinion that the chance\u000aof getting money should be preferred, but Vatsyayana says that money has\u000aonly a limited importance, while a disaster that is once averted may\u000anever occur again. Here, however, the choice should be guided by the\u000agreatness or smallness of the disaster.\u000a\u000aThe gains of the wealthiest and best kind of courtesans are to be spent\u000aas follows:\u000a\u000aBuilding temples, tanks, and gardens; giving a thousand cows to\u000adifferent Brahmans; carrying on the worship of the Gods, and celebrating\u000afestivals in their honour; and, lastly, performing such vows as may be\u000awithin their means.\u000a\u000aThe gains of other courtesans are to be spent as follows:\u000a\u000aHaving a white dress to wear every day; getting sufficient food and\u000adrink to satisfy hunger and thirst; eating daily a perfumed Tambula,\u000a_i.e._, a mixture of betel nut and betel leaves; and wearing ornaments\u000agilt with gold. The Sages say that these represent the gains of all the\u000amiddle and lower classes of courtesans, but Vatsyayana is of opinion\u000athat their gains cannot be calculated, or fixed in any way, as these\u000adepend on the influence of the place, the customs of the people, their\u000aown appearance, and many other things.\u000a\u000aWhen a courtesan wants to keep some particular man from some other\u000awoman; or wants to get him away from some woman to whom he may be\u000aattached; or to deprive some woman of the gains realized by her from\u000ahim; or if she thinks that she would raise her position; or enjoy some\u000agreat good fortune; or become desirable to all men by uniting herself\u000awith this man; or if she wishes to get his assistance in averting some\u000amisfortune; or is really attached to him and loves him; or wishes to\u000ainjure somebody through his means; or has regard to some former favour\u000aconferred upon her by him; or wishes to be united with him merely from\u000adesire; or any of the above reasons, she should agree to take from him\u000aonly a small sum of money in a friendly way.\u000a\u000aWhen a courtesan intends to abandon a particular lover, and take up with\u000aanother one; or when she has reason to believe that her lover will\u000ashortly leave her, and return to his wives; or that having squandered\u000aall his money, and became penniless, his guardian, or master, or father\u000awould come and take him away; or that her lover is about to lose his\u000aposition, or lastly, that he is of a very fickle mind, she should, under\u000aany of these circumstances, endeavour to get as much money as she can\u000afrom him as soon as possible.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, when the courtesan thinks that her lover is about to\u000areceive valuable presents; or get a place of authority from the King; or\u000abe near the time of inheriting a fortune; or that his ship would soon\u000aarrive laden with merchandise; or that he has large stocks of corn and\u000aother commodities; or that if anything was done for him it would not be\u000adone in vain; or that he is always true to his word; then should she\u000ahave regard to her future welfare, and live with the man like a wife.\u000a\u000aThere are also verses on the subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"In considering her present gains, and her future welfare, a courtesan\u000ashould avoid such persons as have gained their means of subsistence with\u000avery great difficulty, as also those who have become selfish and\u000ahard-hearted by becoming the favourites of Kings."\u000a\u000a"She should make every endeavour to unite herself with prosperous and\u000awell-to-do people, and with those whom it is dangerous to avoid, or to\u000aslight in any way. Even at some cost to herself she should become\u000aacquainted with energetic and liberal-minded men, who when pleased would\u000agive her a large sum of money, even for very little service, or for some\u000asmall thing."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER VI.\u000a\u000aOF GAINS AND LOSSES; ATTENDANT GAINS AND LOSSES; AND DOUBTS; AS ALSO OF\u000aTHE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COURTESANS.\u000a\u000a\u000aIt sometimes happens that while gains are being sought for, or expected\u000ato be realised, that losses only are the result of our efforts, the\u000acauses of these losses are:\u000a\u000aWeakness of intellect.\u000a\u000aExcessive love.\u000a\u000aExcessive pride.\u000a\u000aExcessive self conceit.\u000a\u000aExcessive simplicity.\u000a\u000aExcessive confidence.\u000a\u000aExcessive anger.\u000a\u000aCarelessness.\u000a\u000aRecklessness.\u000a\u000aInfluence of evil genius.\u000a\u000aAccidental circumstances.\u000a\u000aThe results of these losses are:\u000a\u000aExpense incurred without any result.\u000a\u000aDestruction of future good fortune.\u000a\u000aStoppage of gains about to be realized.\u000a\u000aLoss of what is already obtained.\u000a\u000aAcquisition of a sour temper.\u000a\u000aBecoming unaimiable to every body.\u000a\u000aInjury to health.\u000a\u000aLoss of hair and other accidents.\u000a\u000aNow gain is of three kinds, viz.: gain of wealth, gain of religious\u000amerit, and gain of pleasure; and similarly, loss is of three kinds,\u000aviz.: loss of wealth, loss of religious merit, and loss of pleasure. At\u000athe time when gains are sought for, if other gains come along with them,\u000athese are called attendant gains. When gain is uncertain, the doubt of\u000aits being a gain is called a simple doubt. When there is a doubt\u000awhether either of two things will happen or not, it is called a mixed\u000adoubt. If while one thing is being done two results take place, it is\u000acalled a combination of two results, and if several results follow from\u000athe same action, it is called a combination of results on every side.\u000a\u000aWe shall now give examples of the above.\u000a\u000aAs already stated, gain is of three kinds, and loss, which is opposed to\u000again, is also of three kinds.\u000a\u000a(a). When by living with a great man a courtesan acquires present\u000awealth, and in addition to this becomes acquainted with other people,\u000aand thus obtains a chance of future fortune, and an accession of wealth,\u000aand becomes desirable to all, this is called a gain of wealth attended\u000aby other gain.\u000a\u000a(b). When by living with a man a courtesan simply gets money, this is\u000acalled a gain of wealth not attended by any other gain.\u000a\u000a(c). When a courtesan receives money from other people besides her\u000alover, the results are: the chance of the loss of future good from her\u000apresent lover; the chance of disaffection of a man securely attached to\u000aher; the hatred of all; and the chance of a union with some low person,\u000atending to destroy her future good. This gain is called a gain of wealth\u000aattended by losses.\u000a\u000a(d). When a courtesan, at her own expense, and without any results in\u000athe shape of gain, has connected with a great man, or an avaricious\u000aminister, for the sake of diverting some misfortune, or removing some\u000acause that may be threatening the destruction of a great gain, this loss\u000ais said to be a loss of wealth attended by gains of the future good\u000awhich it may bring about.\u000a\u000a(e). When a courtesan is kind, even at her own expense, to a man who is\u000avery stingy, or to a man proud of his looks, or to an ungrateful man\u000askilled in gaining the heart of others, without any good resulting from\u000athese connections to her in the end, this loss is called a loss of\u000awealth not attended by any gain.\u000a\u000a(f). When a courtesan is kind to any such man as described above, but\u000awho in addition are favourites of the King, and moreover cruel and\u000apowerful, without any good result in the end, and with a chance of her\u000abeing turned away at any moment, this loss is called a loss of wealth\u000aattended by other losses.\u000a\u000aIn this way gains and losses, and attendant gains and losses in\u000areligious merit and pleasures may become known to the reader, and\u000acombinations of all of them may also be made.\u000a\u000aThus end the remarks on gains and losses, and attendant gains and\u000alosses.\u000a\u000aIn the next place we come to doubts, which are again of three kinds,\u000aviz.: doubts about wealth, doubts about religious merit, and doubts\u000aabout pleasures.\u000a\u000aThe following are examples.\u000a\u000a(a). When a courtesan is not certain how much a man may give her, or\u000aspend upon her, this is called a doubt about wealth.\u000a\u000a(b). When a courtesan feels doubtful whether she is right in entirely\u000aabandoning a lover from whom she is unable to get money, she having\u000ataken all his wealth from him in the first instance, this doubt is\u000acalled a doubt about religious merit.\u000a\u000a(c). When a courtesan is unable to get hold of a lover to her liking,\u000aand is uncertain whether she will derive any pleasure from a person\u000asurrounded by his family, or from a low person, this is called a doubt\u000aabout pleasure.\u000a\u000a(d). When a courtesan is uncertain whether some powerful but low\u000aprincipled fellow would cause loss to her on account of her not being\u000acivil to him, this is called a doubt about the loss of wealth.\u000a\u000a(e). When a courtesan feels doubtful whether she would lose religious\u000amerit by abandoning a man who is attached to her without giving him the\u000aslightest favour, and thereby causing him unhappiness in this world and\u000athe next,[76] this doubt is called a doubt about the loss of a religious\u000amerit.\u000a\u000a(f). When a courtesan is uncertain as to whether she might create\u000adisaffection by speaking out, and revealing her love and thus not get\u000aher desire satisfied, this is called a doubt about the loss of pleasure.\u000a\u000aThus end the remarks on doubts.\u000a\u000a\u000a_Mixed Doubts_.\u000a\u000a(a). The intercourse or connection with a stranger, whose disposition is\u000aunknown, and who may have been introduced by a lover, or by one who\u000apossessed authority, may be productive either of gain or loss, and\u000atherefore this is called a mixed doubt about the gain and loss of\u000awealth.\u000a\u000a(b). When a courtesan is requested by a friend, or is impelled by pity\u000ato have intercourse with a learned Brahman, a religious student, a\u000asacrificer, a devotee, or an ascetic who may have all fallen in love\u000awith her, and who may be consequently at the point of death, by doing\u000athis she might either gain or lose religious merit, and therefore this\u000ais called a mixed doubt about the gain and loss of religious merit.\u000a\u000a(c). If a courtesan relies solely upon the report of other people (_i.e._,\u000ahearsay) about a man, and goes to him without ascertaining herself\u000awhether he possesses good qualities or not, she may either gain or lose\u000apleasure in proportion as he may be good or bad, and therefore this is\u000acalled a mixed doubt about the gain and loss of pleasure.\u000a\u000aUddalika has described the gains and losses on both sides as follows.\u000a\u000a(a). If, when living with a lover, a courtesan gets both wealth and\u000apleasure from him, it is called a gain on both sides.\u000a\u000a(b). When a courtesan lives with a lover at her own expense without\u000agetting any profit out of it, and the lover even takes back from her\u000awhat he may have formerly given her, it is called a loss on both sides.\u000a\u000a(c). When a courtesan is uncertain whether a new acquaintance would\u000abecome attached to her, and, moreover, if he became attached to her,\u000awhether he would give her any thing, it is then called a doubt on both\u000asides about gains.\u000a\u000a(d). When a courtesan is uncertain whether a former enemy, if made up by\u000aher at her own expense, would do her some injury on account of his\u000agrudge against her; or, if becoming attached to her, would take away\u000aangrily from her any thing that he may have given to her, this is called\u000aa doubt on both sides about loss.\u000a\u000aBabhravya has described the gains and losses on both sides as follows.\u000a\u000a(a). When a courtesan can get money from a man whom she may go to see,\u000aand also money from a man whom she may not go to see, this is called a\u000again on both sides.\u000a\u000a(b). When a courtesan has to incur further expense if she goes to see a\u000aman, and yet runs the risk of incurring an irremediable loss if she does\u000anot go to see him, this is called a loss on both sides.\u000a\u000a(c). When a courtesan is uncertain, whether a particular man would give\u000aher anything on her going to see him, without incurring expense on her\u000apart, or whether on her neglecting him another man would give her\u000asomething, this is called a doubt on both sides about gain.\u000a\u000a(d.) When a courtesan is uncertain, whether, on going at her own expense\u000ato see an old enemy, he would take back from her what he may have given\u000aher, or whether by her not going to see him he would cause some disaster\u000ato fall upon her, this is called a doubt on both sides about loss.\u000a\u000aBy combining the above, the following six kinds of mixed results are\u000aproduced, viz.:\u000a\u000a(a). Gain on one side, and loss on the other.\u000a\u000a(b). Gain on one side, and doubt of gain on the other.\u000a\u000a(c). Gain on one side, and doubt of loss on the other.\u000a\u000a(d). Loss on one side, and doubt of gain on the other.\u000a\u000a(e). Doubt of gain on one side, and doubt of loss on the other.\u000a\u000a(f). Doubt of loss on one side, and loss on the other.\u000a\u000aA courtesan, having considered all the above things, and taken council\u000awith her friends, should act so as to acquire gain, the chances of great\u000again, and the warding off of any great disaster. Religious merit and\u000apleasure should also be formed into separate combinations like those of\u000awealth, and then all should be combined with each other, so as to form\u000anew combinations.\u000a\u000aWhen a courtesan consorts with men she should cause each of them to give\u000aher money as well as pleasure. At particular times, such as the Spring\u000aFestivals, etc., she should make her mother announce to the various men,\u000athat on a certain day her daughter would remain with the man who would\u000agratify such and such a desire of hers.\u000a\u000aWhen young men approach her with delight, she should think of what she\u000amay accomplish through them.\u000a\u000aThe combination of gains and losses on all sides are: gain on one side,\u000aand loss on all others; loss on one side and gain on all others; gain on\u000aall sides, loss on all sides.\u000a\u000aA courtesan should also consider doubts about gain and doubts about loss\u000awith reference both to wealth, religious merit, and pleasure.\u000a\u000aThus ends the consideration of gain, loss, attendant gains, attendant\u000alosses, and doubts.\u000a\u000aThe different kinds of courtesans are:\u000a\u000aA bawd.\u000a\u000aA female attendant.\u000a\u000aAn unchaste woman.\u000a\u000aA dancing girl.\u000a\u000aA female artisan.\u000a\u000aA woman who has left her family.\u000a\u000aA woman living on her beauty.\u000a\u000aAnd, finally, a regular courtesan.\u000a\u000aAll the above kinds of courtesans are acquainted with various kinds of\u000amen, and should consider the ways of getting money from them, of\u000apleasing them, of separating themselves from them, and of re-uniting\u000awith them. They should also take into consideration particular gains and\u000alosses, attendant gains and losses, and doubts in accordance with their\u000aseveral conditions.\u000a\u000aThus end the considerations of courtesans.\u000a\u000aThere are also two verses on the subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"Men want pleasure, while women want money, and therefore this Part,\u000awhich treats of the means of gaining wealth, should be studied."\u000a\u000a"There are some women who seek for love, and there are others who seek\u000afor money; for the former the ways of love are told in previous portions\u000aof this work, while the ways of getting money, as practised by\u000acourtesans, are described in this Part."\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 76: The souls of men who die with their desires unfulfilled\u000aare said to go to the world of the Manes, and not direct to the Supreme\u000aSpirit.]\u000a\u000a=END OF PART VI.=\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPART VII.\u000a\u000aABOUT THE MEANS OF ATTRACTING OTHERS TO YOURSELF.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER I.\u000a\u000aON PERSONAL ADORNMENT; ON SUBJUGATING THE HEARTS OF OTHERS; AND ON TONIC\u000aMEDICINES.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen a person fails to obtain the object of his desires by any of the\u000aways previously related, he should then have recourse to other ways of\u000aattracting others to himself.\u000a\u000aNow, good looks, good qualities, youth, and liberality are the chief and\u000amost natural means of making a person agreeable in the eyes of others.\u000aBut in the absence of these a man or a woman must have resort to\u000aartificial means, or to art, and the following are some recipes that may\u000abe found useful.\u000a\u000a(a). An ointment made of the tabernamontana coronaria, the costus\u000aspeciosus or arabicus, and the flacourtia cataphracta, can be used as an\u000aunguent of adornment.\u000a\u000a(b). If a fine powder is made of the above plants, and applied to the\u000awick of a lamp, which is made to burn with the oil of blue vitrol, the\u000ablack pigment or lamp black produced therefrom, when applied to the\u000aeye-lashes, has the effect of making a person look lovely.\u000a\u000a(c). The oil of the hog weed, the echites putescens, the sarina plant,\u000athe yellow amaranth, and the leaf of the nymphæ, if applied to the body,\u000ahas the same effect.\u000a\u000a(d). A black pigment from the same plants produce a similar effect.\u000a\u000a(e). By eating the powder of the nelumbrium speciosum, the blue lotus,\u000aand the mesna roxburghii, with ghee and honey, a man becomes lovely in\u000athe eyes of others.\u000a\u000a(f). The above things, together with the tabernamontana coronaria, and\u000athe xanthochymus pictorius, if used as an ointment, produce the same\u000aresults.\u000a\u000a(g). If the bone of a peacock or of an hyena be covered with gold, and\u000atied on the right hand, it makes a man lovely in the eyes of other\u000apeople.\u000a\u000a(h). In the same way, if a bead, made of the seed of the jujube, or of\u000athe conch shell, be enchanted by the incantations mentioned in the\u000aAtharvana Veda, or by the incantations of those well skilled in the\u000ascience of magic, and tied on the hand, it produces the same result as\u000adescribed above.\u000a\u000a(i). When a female attendant arrives at the age of puberty, her master\u000ashould keep her secluded, and when men ardently desire her on account of\u000aher seclusion, and on account of the difficulty of approaching her, he\u000ashould then bestow her hand on such a person as may endow her with\u000awealth and happiness.\u000a\u000aThis is a means of increasing the loveliness of a person in the eyes of\u000aothers.\u000a\u000aIn the same way, when the daughter of a courtesan arrives at the age of\u000apuberty, the mother should get together a lot of young men of the same\u000aage, disposition, and knowledge as her daughter, and tell them that she\u000awould give her in marriage to the person who would give her presents of\u000aa particular kind.\u000a\u000aAfter this the daughter should be kept in seclusion as far as possible,\u000aand the mother should give her in marriage to the man who may be ready\u000ato give her the presents agreed upon. If the mother is unable to get so\u000amuch out of the man, she should show some of her own things as having\u000abeen given to the daughter by the bridegroom.\u000a\u000aOr, the mother may allow her daughter to be married to the man\u000aprivately, as if she was ignorant of the whole affair, and then\u000apretending that it has come to her knowledge, she may give her consent\u000ato the union.\u000a\u000aThe daughter, too, should make herself attractive to the sons of wealthy\u000acitizens, unknown to her mother, and make them attached to her, and for\u000athis purpose should meet them at the time of learning to sing, and in\u000aplaces where music is played, and at the houses of other people, and\u000athen request her mother, through a female friend, or servant, to be\u000aallowed to unite herself to the man who is most agreeable to her.[77]\u000a\u000aWhen the daughter of a courtesan is thus given to a man, the ties of\u000amarriage should be observed for one year, and after that she may do what\u000ashe likes. But even after the end of the year, when otherwise engaged,\u000aif she should be now and then invited by her first husband to come and\u000asee him, she should put aside her present gain, and go to him for the\u000anight.\u000a\u000aSuch is the mode of temporary marriage among courtesans, and of\u000aincreasing their loveliness, and their value in the eyes of others. What\u000ahas been said about them should also be understood to apply to the\u000adaughters of dancing women, whose mothers should give them only to such\u000apersons as are likely to become useful to them in various ways.\u000a\u000aThus end the ways of making oneself lovely in the eyes of others.\u000a\u000a(a). If a man, after anointing his lingam with a mixture of the powders\u000aof the white thorn apple, the long pepper, and the black pepper, and\u000ahoney, engages in sexual union with a woman, he makes her subject to his\u000awill.\u000a\u000a(b). The application of a mixture of the leaf of the plant vatodbhranta,\u000aof the flowers thrown on a human corpse when carried out to be burnt,\u000aand the powder of the bones of the peacock, and of the jiwanjiva bird,\u000aproduces the same effect.\u000a\u000a(c). The remains of a kite who has died a natural death, ground into\u000apowder, and mixed with cowach and honey, has also the same effect.\u000a\u000a(d). Anointing oneself with an ointment made of the plant emblica\u000amyrabolans has the power of subjecting women to one's will.\u000a\u000a(e). If a man cuts into small pieces the sprouts of the vajnasunhi\u000aplant, and dips them into a mixture of red arsenic and sulphur, and then\u000adries them seven times, and applies this powder mixed with honey to his\u000alingam, he can subjugate a woman to his will directly that he has had\u000asexual union with her, or, if, by burning these very sprouts at night\u000aand looking at the smoke, he sees a golden moon behind, he will then be\u000asuccessful with any woman; or if he throws some of the powder of these\u000asame sprouts mixed with the excrement of a monkey upon a maiden, she\u000awill not be given in marriage to any body else.\u000a\u000a(f). If pieces of the arris root are dressed with the oil of the mango,\u000aand placed for six months in a hole made in the trunk of the sisu tree,\u000aand are then taken out and made up into an ointment, and applied to the\u000alingam, this is said to serve as the means of subjugating women.\u000a\u000a(g). If the bone of a camel is dipped into the juice of the plant\u000aeclipta prostata, and then burnt, and the black pigment produced from\u000aits ashes is placed in a box also made of the bone of a camel, and\u000aapplied together with antimony to the eye lashes with a pencil also made\u000aof the bone of a camel, then that pigment is said to be very pure, and\u000awholesome for the eyes, and serves as a means of subjugating others to\u000athe person who uses it. The same effect can be produced by black pigment\u000amade of the bones of hawks, vultures, and peacocks.\u000a\u000aThus end the ways of subjugating others to one's own will.\u000a\u000aNow the means of increasing sexual vigour are as follows:\u000a\u000a(a). A man obtains sexual vigour by drinking milk mixed with sugar, the\u000aroot of the uchchata plant, the piper chaba, and liquorice.\u000a\u000a(b). Drinking milk mixed with sugar, and having the testicle of a ram or\u000aa goat boiled in it, is also productive of vigour.\u000a\u000a(c). The drinking of the juice of the hedysarum gangeticum, the kuili,\u000aand the kshirika plant mixed with milk, produces the same effect.\u000a\u000a(d). The seed of the long pepper along with the seeds of the sanseviera\u000aroxburghiana, and the hedysarum gangeticum plant, all pounded together,\u000aand mixed with milk, is productive of a similar result.\u000a\u000a(e). According to ancient authors, if a man pounds the seeds or roots of\u000athe trapa bispinosa, the kasurika, the tuscan jasmine, and liquorice,\u000atogether with the kshirakapoli (a kind of onion), and puts the powder\u000ainto milk mixed with sugar and ghee, and having boiled the whole mixture\u000aon a moderate fire, drinks the paste so formed, he will be able to enjoy\u000ainnumerable women.\u000a\u000a(f). In the same way, if a man mixes rice with the eggs of the sparrow,\u000aand having boiled this in milk, adds to it ghee and honey, and drinks as\u000amuch of it as necessary, this will produce the same effect.\u000a\u000a(g). If a man takes the outer covering of sesamum seeds, and soaks them\u000awith the eggs of sparrows, and then, having boiled them in milk, mixed\u000awith sugar and ghee, along with the fruits of the trapa bispinosa and\u000athe kasurika plant, and adding to it the flour of wheat and beans, and\u000athen drinks this composition, he is said to be able to enjoy many women.\u000a\u000a(h). If ghee, honey, sugar, and liquorice in equal quantities, the juice\u000aof the fennel plant, and milk are mixed together, this nectar-like\u000acomposition is said to be holy, and provocative of sexual vigour, a\u000apreservative of life, and sweet to the taste.\u000a\u000a(i). The drinking of a paste composed of the asparagus racemosus, the\u000ashvadaushtra plant, the guduchi plant, the long pepper, and liquorice,\u000aboiled in milk, honey, and ghee, in the spring, is said to have the same\u000aeffect as the above.\u000a\u000a(j). Boiling the asparagus racemosus, and the shvadaushtra plant, along\u000awith the pounded fruits of the premna spinosa in water, and drinking the\u000asame, is said to act in the same way.\u000a\u000a(k). Drinking boiled ghee, or clarified butter in the morning during the\u000aspring season, is said to be beneficial to health and strength, and\u000aagreeable to the taste.\u000a\u000a(l). If the powder of the seed of the shvadaushtra plant and the flower\u000aof barley are mixed together in equal parts, and a portion of it, _i.e._,\u000atwo palas in weight, is eaten every morning on getting up, it has the\u000asame effect as the preceding recipe.\u000a\u000aThere are also verses on the subject as follows:\u000a\u000a"The means[78] of producing love and sexual vigour should be learnt from\u000athe science of medicine, from the Vedas, from those who are learned in\u000athe arts of magic, and from confidential relatives. No means should be\u000atried which are doubtful in their effects, which are likely to cause\u000ainjury to the body, which involve the death of animals, and which bring\u000aus in contact with impure things. Such means should only be used as are\u000aholy, acknowledged to be good, and approved of by Brahmans, and\u000afriends."\u000a\u000aFOOTNOTE:\u000a\u000a[Footnote 77: It is a custom of the courtesans of Oriental countries to\u000agive their daughters temporarily in marriage when they come of age, and\u000aafter they have received an education in the Kama Sutra and other arts.\u000aFull details are given of this at page 76 of "Early Ideas, a group of\u000aHindoo stories, collected and collated by Anaryan.

At the\u000acommencement he should rub her yoni with his hand or fingers, and not\u000abegin to have intercourse with her until she becomes excited, or\u000aexperiences pleasure. This is one way of exciting a woman.\u000a\u000aOr, he may make use of certain Apadravyas, or things which are put on or\u000aaround the lingam to supplement its length or its thickness, so as to\u000afit it to the yoni. In the opinion of Babhravya, these Apadravyas should\u000abe made of gold, silver, copper, iron, ivory, buffalo's horn, various\u000akinds of wood, tin or lead, and should be soft, cool, provocative of\u000asexual vigour, and well fitted to serve the intended purpose.\u000aVatsyayana, however, says that they may be made according to the natural\u000aliking of each individual.\u000a\u000aThe following are the different kinds of Apadravyas.\u000a\u000a(1). "The armlet" (Valaya) should be of the same size as the lingam, and\u000ashould have its outer surface made rough with globules.\u000a\u000a(2). "The couple" (Sanghati) is formed of two armlets.\u000a\u000a(3). "The bracelet" (Chudaka) is made by joining three or more armlets,\u000auntil they come up to the required length of the lingam.\u000a\u000a(4). "The single bracelet" is formed by wrapping a single wire around\u000athe lingam, according to its dimensions.\u000a\u000a(5). The Kantuka or Jalaka is a tube open at both ends, with a hole\u000athrough it, outwardly rough and studded with soft globules, and made to\u000afit the side of the yoni, and tied to the waist.\u000a\u000aWhen such a thing cannot be obtained, then a tube made of the wood\u000aapple, or tubular stalk of the bottle gourd, or a reed made soft with\u000aoil and extracts of plants, and tied to the waist with strings, may be\u000amade use of, as also a row of soft pieces of wood tied together.\u000a\u000aThe above are the things that can be used in connection with or in the\u000aplace of the lingam.\u000a\u000aThe people of the southern countries think that true sexual pleasure\u000acannot be obtained without perforating the lingam, and they therefore\u000acause it to be pierced like the lobes of the ears of an infant pierced\u000afor earrings.\u000a\u000aNow, when a young man perforates his lingam he should pierce it with a\u000asharp instrument, and then stand in water so long as the blood continues\u000ato flow. At night he should engage in sexual intercourse, even with\u000avigour, so as to clean the hole. After this he should continue to wash\u000athe hole with decoctions, and increase the size by putting into it small\u000apieces of cane, and the wrightia antidysenterica, and thus gradually\u000aenlarging the orifice. It may also be washed with liquorice mixed with\u000ahoney, and the size of the hole increased by the fruit stalks of the\u000asima-patra plant. The hole should be annointed with a small quantity of\u000aoil.\u000a\u000aIn the hole made in the lingam a man may put Apadravyas of various\u000aforms, such as the "round," the "round on one side," the "wooden\u000amortar," the "flower," the "armlet," the "bone of the heron," the "goad\u000aof the elephant," the "collection of eight balls," the "lock of hair,"\u000athe "place where four roads meet," and other things named according to\u000atheir forms and means of using them. All these Apadravyas should be\u000arough on the outside according to their requirements.\u000a\u000aThe ways of enlarging the lingam must be now related.\u000a\u000aWhen a man wishes to enlarge his lingam, he should rub it with the\u000abristles of certain insects that live in trees, and then, after rubbing\u000ait for ten nights with oils, he should again rub it with the bristles as\u000abefore. By continuing to do this a swelling will be gradually produced\u000ain the lingam, and he should then lie on a cot, and cause his lingam to\u000ahang down through a hole in the cot. After this he should take away all\u000athe pain from the swelling by using cool concoctions. The swelling,\u000awhich is called "Suka," and is often brought about among the people of\u000athe Dravida country, lasts for life.\u000a\u000aIf the lingam is rubbed with the following things, viz., the plant\u000aphysalis flexuosa, the shavara-kandaka plant, the jalasuka plant, the\u000afruit of the egg plant, the butter of a she buffalo, the hastri-charma\u000aplant, and the juice of the vajra-rasa plant, a swelling lasting for one\u000amonth will be produced.\u000a\u000aBy rubbing it with oil boiled in the concoctions of the above things,\u000athe same effect will be produced, but lasting for six months.\u000a\u000aThe enlargement of the lingam is also effected by rubbing it or\u000amoistening it with oil boiled on a moderate fire along with the seeds of\u000athe pomegranate, and the cucumber, the juices of the valuka plant, the\u000ahasti-charma plant, and the egg-plant.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the above, other means may be learnt from experienced and\u000aconfidential persons.\u000a\u000aThe miscellaneous experiments and recipes are as follows:\u000a\u000a(a). If a man mixes the powder of the milk hedge plant, and the kantaka\u000aplant with the excrement of a monkey, and the powdered root of the\u000alanjalalika plant, and throws this mixture on a woman, she will not love\u000aany body else afterwards.\u000a\u000a(b). If a man thickens the juice of the fruits of the cassia fistula,\u000aand the eugenia jambolana by mixing them with the powder of the soma\u000aplant, the vernonia anthelmintica, the eclipta prostata, and the\u000alohopa-jihirka, and applies this composition to the yoni of a woman, and\u000athen has sexual intercourse with her, his love for her will be\u000adestroyed.\u000a\u000a(c). The same effect is produced if a man has connection with a woman\u000awho has bathed in the butter-milk of a she-buffalo mixed with the\u000apowders of the gopalika plant, the banu-padika plant, and the yellow\u000aamaranth.\u000a\u000a(d). An ointment made of the flowers of the nauclea cadamba, the hog\u000aplum, and the eugenia jambolana, and used by a woman, causes her to be\u000adisliked by her husband.\u000a\u000a(e). Garlands made of the above flowers, when worn by the woman, produce\u000athe same effect.\u000a\u000a(f). An ointment made of the fruit of the asteracantha longifolia\u000a(kokilaksha) will contract the yoni of a Hastini or elephant woman, and\u000athis contraction lasts for one night.\u000a\u000a(g). An ointment made by pounding the roots of the nelumbrium speciosum,\u000aand of the blue lotus, and the powder of the plant physalis flexuosa\u000amixed with ghee and honey, will enlarge the yoni of the Mrigi or deer\u000awoman.\u000a\u000a(h). An ointment made of the fruit of the emblica myrabolans soaked in\u000athe milky juice of the milk hedge plant, of the soma plant, the\u000acalotropis gigantea, and the juice of the fruit of the vernonia\u000aanthelmintica, will make the hair white.\u000a\u000a(i). The juice of the roots of the madayantaka plant, the yellow\u000aamaranth, the anjanika plant, the clitoria ternateea, and the\u000ashlakshnaparni plant, used as a lotion, will make the hair grow.\u000a\u000a(j). An ointment made by boiling the above roots in oil, and rubbed in,\u000awill make the hair black, and will also gradually restore hair that has\u000afallen off.\u000a\u000a(k) If lac is saturated seven times in the sweat of the testicle of a\u000awhite horse, and applied to a red lip, the lip will become white.\u000a\u000a(l). The colour of the lips can be regained by means of the madayantika\u000aand other plants mentioned above under (i).\u000a\u000a(m). A woman who hears a man playing on a reed pipe which has been\u000adressed with the juices of the bahupadika plant, the tabernamontana\u000acoronaria, the costus speciosus or arabicus, the pinus deodora, the\u000aeuphorbia antiquorum, the vajra and the kantaka plant, becomes his\u000aslave.\u000a\u000a(n). If food be mixed with the fruit of the thorn apple (Dathura) it\u000acauses intoxication.\u000a\u000a(o). If water be mixed with oil and the ashes of any kind of grass\u000aexcept the kusha grass, it becomes the colour of milk.\u000a\u000a(p). If yellow myrabolans, the hog plum, the shrawana plant, and the\u000apriyangu plant be all pounded together, and applied to iron pots, these\u000apots become red.\u000a\u000a(q). If a lamp, trimmed with oil extracted from the shrawana and\u000apriyangn plants, its wick being made of cloth and the slough of the\u000askins of snakes, is lighted, and long pieces of wood placed near it,\u000athose pieces of wood will resemble so many snakes.\u000a\u000a(r). Drinking the milk of a white cow who has a white calf at her feet\u000ais auspicious, produces fame, and preserves life.\u000a\u000a(s). The blessings of venerable Brahmans, well propitiated, have the\u000asame effect.\u000a\u000aThere are also some verses in conclusion:\u000a\u000a"Thus have I written in a few words the 'Science of love,' after reading\u000athe texts of ancient authors, and following the ways of enjoyment\u000amentioned in them."\u000a\u000a"He who is acquainted with the true principles of this science pays\u000aregard to Dharma, Artha, Kama, and to his own experiences, as well as to\u000athe teachings of others, and does not act simply on the dictates of his\u000aown desire. As for the errors in the science of love which I have\u000amentioned in this work, on my own authority as an author, I have,\u000aimmediately after mentioning them, carefully censured and prohibited\u000athem."\u000a\u000a"An act is never looked upon with indulgence for the simple reason that\u000ait is authorised by the science, because it ought to be remembered that\u000ait is the intention of the science, that the rules which it contains\u000ashould only be acted upon in particular cases. After reading and\u000aconsidering the works of Babhravya and other ancient authors, and\u000athinking over the meaning of the rules given by them, the Kama Sutra was\u000acomposed, according to the precepts of Holy Writ, for the benefit of the\u000aworld, by Vatsyayana, while leading the life of a religious student, and\u000awholly engaged in the contemplation of the Deity."\u000a\u000a"This work is not intended to be used merely as an instrument for\u000asatisfying our desires. A person, acquainted with the true principles of\u000athis science, and who preserves his Dharma, Artha, and Kama, and has\u000aregard for the practices of the people, is sure to obtain the mastery\u000aover his senses."\u000a\u000a"In short, an intelligent and prudent person, attending to Dharma and\u000aArtha, and attending to Kama also, without becoming the slave of his\u000apassions, obtains success in everything that he may undertake."\u000a\u000a=END OF PART VII.=\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCONCLUDING REMARKS.\u000a\u000a\u000aThus ends, in seven parts, the Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana, which might\u000aotherwise be called a treatise on men and women, their mutual\u000arelationship, and connection with each other.\u000a\u000aIt is a work that should be studied by all, both old and young; the\u000aformer will find in it real truths, gathered by experience, and already\u000atested by themselves, while the latter will derive the great advantage\u000aof learning things, which some perhaps may otherwise never learn at all,\u000aor which they may only learn when it is too late ("too late" those\u000aimmortal words of Mirabeau) to profit by the learning.\u000a\u000aIt can also be fairly commended to the student of social science and of\u000ahumanity, and above all to the student of those early ideas, which have\u000agradually filtered down through the sands of time, and which seem to\u000aprove that the human nature of to-day is much the same as the human\u000anature of the long ago.\u000a\u000aIt has been said of Balzac [the great, if not the greatest of French\u000anovelists] that he seemed to have inherited a natural and intuitive\u000aperception of the feelings of men and women, and has described them with\u000aan analysis worthy of a man of science. The author of the present work\u000amust also have had a considerable knowledge of the humanities. Many of\u000ahis remarks are so full of simplicity and truth, that they have stood\u000athe test of time, and stand out still as clear and true as when they\u000awere first written, some eighteen hundred years ago.\u000a\u000aAs a collection of facts, told in plain and simple language, it must be\u000aremembered that in those early days there was apparently no idea of\u000aembellishing the work, either with a literary style, a flow of\u000alanguage, or a quantity of superfluous padding. The author tells the\u000aworld what he knows in very concise language, without any attempt to\u000aproduce an interesting story. From his facts how many novels could be\u000awritten! Indeed much of the matter contained in parts III. IV. V. and\u000aVI., has formed the basis of many of the stories and the tales of past\u000acenturies.\u000a\u000aThere will be found in part VII., some curious recipes. Many of them\u000aappear to be as primitive as the book itself, but in later works of the\u000asame nature these recipes and prescriptions appear to have increased,\u000aboth as regards quality and quantity. In the Anunga Runga or "The Stage\u000aof Love," mentioned at page 5 of the Preface in Part I., there are found\u000ano less than thirty-three different subjects for which one hundred and\u000athirty recipes and prescriptions are given.\u000a\u000aAs the details may be interesting, these subjects are described as\u000afollows:\u000a\u000a1. For hastening the paroxysm of the woman.\u000a\u000a2. For delaying the organs of the man.\u000a\u000a3. Aphrodisiacs.\u000a\u000a4. For thickening and enlarging the lingam, rendering it sound and\u000astrong, hard and lusty.\u000a\u000a5. For narrowing and contracting the yoni.\u000a\u000a6. For perfuming the yoni.\u000a\u000a7. For removing and destroying the hair of the body.\u000a\u000a8. For removing the sudden stopping of the monthly ailment.\u000a\u000a9. For abating the immoderate appearance of the monthly ailment.\u000a\u000a10. For purifying the womb.\u000a\u000a11. For causing pregnancy.\u000a\u000a12. For preventing miscarriage and other accidents.\u000a\u000a13. For ensuring easy labour and ready deliverance.\u000a\u000a14. For limiting the number of children.\u000a\u000a15. For thickening and beautifying the hair.\u000a\u000a16. For obtaining a good black colour to it.\u000a\u000a17. For whitening and bleaching it.\u000a\u000a18. For renewing it.\u000a\u000a19. For clearing the skin of the face from eruptions that break out and\u000aleave black spots upon it.\u000a\u000a20. For removing the black colour of the epidermis.\u000a\u000a21. For enlarging the breasts of women.\u000a\u000a22. For raising and hardening pendulous breasts.\u000a\u000a23. For giving a fragrance to the skin.\u000a\u000a24. For removing the evil savour of perspiration.\u000a\u000a25. For anointing the body after bathing.\u000a\u000a26. For causing a pleasant smell to the breath.\u000a\u000a27. Drugs and charms for the purposes of fascinating, overcoming, and\u000asubduing either men or women.\u000a\u000a28. Recipes for enabling a woman to attract and preserve her husband's\u000alove.\u000a\u000a29. Magical collyriums for winning love and friendship.\u000a\u000a30. Prescriptions for reducing other persons to submission.\u000a\u000a31. Philter pills, and other charms.\u000a\u000a32. Fascinating incense, or fumigation.\u000a\u000a33. Magical verses which have the power of fascination.\u000a\u000aOf the one hundred and thirty recipes given, many of them are absurd,\u000abut not more perhaps than many of the recipes and prescriptions in use\u000ain Europe not so very long ago. Love-philters, charms, and herbal\u000aremedies have been, in early days, as freely used in Europe as in Asia,\u000aand doubtless some people believe in them still in many places.\u000a\u000aAnd now, one word about the author of the work, the good old sage\u000aVatsyayana. It is much to be regretted that nothing can be discovered\u000aabout his life, his belongings, and his surroundings. At the end of Part\u000aVII. he states that he wrote the work while leading the life of a\u000areligious student [probably at Benares] and while wholly engaged in the\u000acontemplation of the Deity. He must have arrived at a certain age at\u000athat time, for throughout he gives us the benefit of his experience, and\u000aof his opinions, and these bear the stamp of age rather than of youth;\u000aindeed the work could hardly have been written by a young man.\u000a\u000aIn a beautiful verse of the Vedas of the Christians it has been said of\u000athe peaceful dead, that they rest from their labours, and that their\u000aworks do follow them. Yes indeed, the works of men of genius do follow\u000athem, and remain as a lasting treasure. And though there may be\u000adisputes and discussions about the immortality of the body or the soul,\u000anobody can deny the immortality of genius, which ever remains as a\u000abright and guiding star to the struggling humanities of succeeding ages.\u000aThis work, then, which has stood the test of centuries, has placed\u000aVatsyayana among the immortals, and on This, and on Him no better elegy\u000aor eulogy can be written than the following lines:\u000a\u000a   "So long as lips shall kiss, and eyes shall see,\u000a   So long lives This, and This gives life to Thee."\u000a\u000a       *       *       *       *       *\u000a\u000a_Works issued by the Council of the_ KAMA SHASTRA SOCIETY.\u000a\u000a\u000a_DETAILED PROSPECTUSES CAN BE HAD._\u000a\u000a\u000aII.\u000a\u000a   ANANGA-RANGA,\u000a   (_Stage of the Bodiless One_)\u000a   OR THE\u000a   HINDOO ART OF LOVE,\u000a   (_Ars Amoris Indica_,)\u000a\u000a   TRANSLATED FROM THE SANSKRIT AND ANNOTATED BY\u000a   A.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\u000aLiterary Archive Foundation\u000a\u000aProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\u000aspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\u000aincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\u000afreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\u000aarray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\u000a($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\u000astatus with the IRS.\u000a\u000aThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\u000acharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\u000aStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\u000aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\u000awith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\u000awhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\u000aSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\u000aparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\u000a\u000aWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\u000ahave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\u000aagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\u000aapproach us with offers to donate.\u000a\u000aInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\u000aany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\u000aoutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\u000a\u000aPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\u000amethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\u000aways including including checks, online payments and credit card\u000adonations.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\u000aconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\u000awith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\u000aGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\u000a\u000a\u000aProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\u000aeditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\u000aunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\u000akeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\u000a\u000a\u000aMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\u000a\u000a     http://www.gutenberg.net\u000a\u000aThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\u000aincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\u000aArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\u000asubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\u000a
