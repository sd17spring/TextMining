He lay on\u000ahis armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could\u000asee his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff\u000asections.  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready\u000ato slide off any moment.  His many legs, pitifully thin compared\u000awith the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he\u000alooked.\u000a\u000a"What's happened to me?" he thought.  It wasn't a dream.  His room,\u000aa proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully\u000abetween its four familiar walls.  A collection of textile samples\u000alay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and\u000aabove it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an\u000aillustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.  It showed\u000aa lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,\u000araising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm\u000atowards the viewer.\u000a\u000aGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.\u000aDrops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel\u000aquite sad.  "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all\u000athis nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to\u000ado because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present\u000astate couldn't get into that position.  However hard he threw\u000ahimself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.  He\u000amust have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he\u000awouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when\u000ahe began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt\u000abefore.\u000a\u000a"Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've\u000achosen! Travelling day in and day out.  Doing business like this\u000atakes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on\u000atop of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making\u000atrain connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different\u000apeople all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or\u000abecome friendly with them.  It can all go to Hell!"  He felt a\u000aslight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back\u000atowards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found\u000awhere the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little\u000awhite spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried\u000ato feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back\u000abecause as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.\u000a\u000aHe slid back into his former position.  "Getting up early all the\u000atime", he thought, "it makes you stupid.  You've got to get enough\u000asleep.  Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.  For\u000ainstance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning\u000ato copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting\u000athere eating their breakfasts.  I ought to just try that with my\u000aboss; I'd get kicked out on the spot.  But who knows, maybe that\u000awould be the best thing for me.  If I didn't have my parents to\u000athink about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have\u000agone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him\u000aeverything I would, let him know just what I feel.  He'd fall right\u000aoff his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up\u000athere at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\u000aespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is\u000ahard of hearing.  Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the\u000amoney together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or\u000asix years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do.  That's when\u000aI'll make the big change.  First of all though, I've got to get up,\u000amy train leaves at five."\u000a\u000aAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of\u000adrawers.  "God in Heaven!" he thought.  It was half past six and the\u000ahands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half\u000apast, more like quarter to seven.  Had the alarm clock not rung? He\u000acould see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it\u000ashould have been; it certainly must have rung.  Yes, but was it\u000apossible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?\u000aTrue, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply\u000abecause of that.  What should he do now? The next train went at\u000aseven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and\u000athe collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at\u000aall feel particularly fresh and lively.  And even if he did catch\u000athe train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office\u000aassistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he\u000awould have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long\u000atime ago.  The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and\u000awith no understanding.  What about if he reported sick? But that\u000awould be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of\u000aservice Gregor had never once yet been ill.  His boss would\u000acertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance\u000acompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the\u000adoctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed\u000athat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.  And what's\u000amore, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in\u000afact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long,\u000afeel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\u000a\u000aHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide\u000ato get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.\u000aThere was a cautious knock at the door near his head.  "Gregor",\u000asomebody called - it was his mother - "it's quarter to seven.\u000aDidn't you want to go somewhere?"  That gentle voice! Gregor was\u000ashocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be\u000arecognised as the voice he had had before.  As if from deep inside\u000ahim, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with\u000ait, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort\u000aof echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether\u000ahe had heard properly or not.  Gregor had wanted to give a full\u000aanswer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented\u000ahimself with saying: "Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I'm getting up\u000anow."  The change in Gregor's voice probably could not be noticed\u000aoutside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with\u000athis explanation and shuffled away.  But this short conversation\u000amade the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against\u000atheir expectations was still at home, and soon his father came\u000aknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.\u000a"Gregor, Gregor", he called, "what's wrong?"  And after a short\u000awhile he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: "Gregor!\u000aGregor!"  At the other side door his sister came plaintively:\u000a"Gregor? Aren't you well? Do you need anything?"  Gregor answered to\u000aboth sides: "I'm ready, now", making an effort to remove all the\u000astrangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting\u000along pauses between each, individual word.  His father went back to\u000ahis breakfast, but his sister whispered: "Gregor, open the door, I\u000abeg of you."  Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door,\u000aand instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired\u000afrom his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was\u000aat home.\u000a\u000aThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\u000adisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast.\u000aOnly then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware\u000athat he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by\u000alying in bed.  He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in\u000abed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned\u000aout to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would\u000aslowly resolve themselves today.  He did not have the slightest\u000adoubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first\u000asign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for\u000atravelling salesmen.\u000a\u000aIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow\u000ahimself up a little and they fell off by themselves.  But it became\u000adifficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad.\u000aHe would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but\u000ainstead of them he only had all those little legs continuously\u000amoving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to\u000acontrol.  If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first\u000aone that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do\u000awhat he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free\u000aand would move about painfully.  "This is something that can't be\u000adone in bed", Gregor said to himself, "so don't keep trying to do\u000ait".\u000a\u000aThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body\u000aout of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not\u000aimagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move;\u000ait went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he\u000acarelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could\u000agather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower\u000abedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower\u000apart of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.\u000a\u000aSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed\u000afirst, carefully turning his head to the side.  This he managed\u000aquite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of\u000ahis body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head.\u000aBut when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the\u000afresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be\u000aa miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry\u000aon pushing himself forward the same way.  And he could not knock\u000ahimself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose\u000aconsciousness.\u000a\u000aIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been\u000aearlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching\u000ahis legs as they struggled against each other even harder than\u000abefore, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing\u000apeace and order to this chaos.  He told himself once more that it\u000awas not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible\u000athing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at\u000awhatever sacrifice.  At the same time, though, he did not forget to\u000aremind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing\u000ato desperate conclusions.  At times like this he would direct his\u000aeyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but\u000aunfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\u000aenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer\u000ato offer him.  "Seven o'clock, already", he said to himself when the\u000aclock struck again, "seven o'clock, and there's still a fog like\u000athis."  And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly\u000aas if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back\u000ato their real and natural state.\u000a\u000aBut then he said to himself: "Before it strikes quarter past seven\u000aI'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.  And by then\u000asomebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to me\u000aas well, as they open up at work before seven o'clock."  And so he\u000aset himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body\u000aout of the bed all at the same time.  If he succeeded in falling out\u000aof bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could\u000aprobably avoid injuring it.  His back seemed to be quite hard, and\u000aprobably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet.  His\u000amain concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which\u000aeven through all the doors would probably raise concern if not\u000aalarm.  But it was something that had to be risked.\u000a\u000aWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new\u000amethod was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock\u000aback and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would be\u000aif somebody came to help him.  Two strong people - he had his father\u000aand the maid in mind - would have been more than enough; they would\u000aonly have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him\u000aaway from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and\u000acareful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the\u000alittle legs would find a use.  Should he really call for help\u000athough, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked?\u000aDespite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile\u000aat this thought.\u000a\u000aAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have\u000abeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard.  The\u000atime was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final\u000adecision very soon.  Then there was a ring at the door of the flat.\u000a"That'll be someone from work", he said to himself, and froze very\u000astill, although his little legs only became all the more lively as\u000athey danced around.  For a moment everything remained quiet.\u000a"They're not opening the door", Gregor said to himself, caught in\u000asome nonsensical hope.  But then of course, the maid's firm steps\u000awent to the door as ever and opened it.  Gregor only needed to hear\u000athe visitor's first words of greeting and he knew who it was - the\u000achief clerk himself.  Why did Gregor have to be the only one\u000acondemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly\u000asuspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every\u000aone of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and\u000adevoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\u000acouldn't get out of bed if he didn't spend at least a couple of\u000ahours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough\u000ato let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were\u000aeven necessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did\u000athey have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so\u000asuspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the\u000awisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made\u000ahim upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with\u000aall his force out of the bed.  There was a loud thump, but it wasn't\u000areally a loud noise.  His fall was softened a little by the carpet,\u000aand Gregor's back was also more elastic than he had thought, which\u000amade the sound muffled and not too noticeable.  He had not held his\u000ahead carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in\u000apain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.\u000a\u000a"Something's fallen down in there", said the chief clerk in the room\u000aon the left.  Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort\u000athat had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk\u000atoo; you had to concede that it was possible.  But as if in gruff\u000areply to this question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in his\u000ahighly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room.\u000aFrom the room on his right, Gregor's sister whispered to him to let\u000ahim know: "Gregor, the chief clerk is here."  "Yes, I know", said\u000aGregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough\u000afor his sister to hear him.\u000a\u000a"Gregor", said his father now from the room to his left, "the chief\u000aclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn't leave on the\u000aearly train.  We don't know what to say to him.  And anyway, he\u000awants to speak to you personally.  So please open up this door.  I'm\u000asure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room."\u000aThen the chief clerk called "Good morning,  Mr. Samsa". "He isn't\u000awell", said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father\u000acontinued to speak through the door.  "He isn't well, please believe\u000ame.  Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever\u000athinks about the business.  It nearly makes me cross the way he\u000anever goes out in the evenings; he's been in town for a week now but\u000astayed home every evening.  He sits with us in the kitchen and just\u000areads the paper or studies train timetables.  His idea of relaxation\u000ais working with his fretsaw.  He's made a little frame, for\u000ainstance, it only took him two or three evenings, you'll be amazed\u000ahow nice it is; it's hanging up in his room; you'll see it as soon\u000aas Gregor opens the door.  Anyway, I'm glad you're here; we wouldn't\u000ahave been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he's so\u000astubborn; and I'm sure he isn't well, he said this morning that he\u000ais, but he isn't."  "I'll be there in a moment", said Gregor slowly\u000aand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any\u000aword of the conversation.  "Well I can't think of any other way of\u000aexplaining it,  Mrs. Samsa", said the chief clerk, "I hope it's\u000anothing serious.  But on the other hand, I must say that if we\u000apeople in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or\u000aunfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of\u000abusiness considerations."  "Can the chief clerk come in to see you\u000anow then?", asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door\u000aagain.  "No", said Gregor.  In the room on his right there followed\u000aa painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.\u000a\u000aSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably\u000aonly just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.  And why was\u000ashe crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the\u000achief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if\u000athat happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the\u000asame demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like\u000athat yet.  Gregor was still there and had not the slightest\u000aintention of abandoning his family.  For the time being he just lay\u000athere on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in\u000awould seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in.  It was\u000aonly a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be\u000afound for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could\u000abe sacked on the spot.  And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible\u000ato leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at\u000ahim and crying.  But the others didn't know what was happening, they\u000awere worried, that would excuse their behaviour.\u000a\u000aThe chief clerk now raised his voice, "Mr. Samsa", he called to him,\u000a"what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more\u000athan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and\u000aunnecessary concern to your parents and you fail - and I mention\u000athis just by the way - you fail to carry out your business duties in\u000aa way that is quite unheard of.  I'm speaking here on behalf of your\u000aparents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and\u000aimmediate explanation.  I am astonished, quite astonished.  I\u000athought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you\u000asuddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims.  This morning,\u000ayour employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to\u000aappear, it's true - it had to do with the money that was recently\u000aentrusted to you - but I came near to giving him my word of honour\u000athat that could not be the right explanation.  But now that I see\u000ayour incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish\u000awhatsoever to intercede on your behalf.  And nor is your position\u000aall that secure.  I had originally intended to say all this to you\u000ain private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good\u000areason I don't see why your parents should not also learn of it.\u000aYour turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that\u000ait's not the time of year to do especially good business, we\u000arecognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do no\u000abusiness at all,  Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be."\u000a\u000a"But Sir", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in\u000athe excitement, "I'll open up immediately, just a moment.  I'm\u000aslightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven't been able to get\u000aup.  I'm still in bed now.  I'm quite fresh again now, though.  I'm\u000ajust getting out of bed.  Just a moment.  Be patient! It's not quite\u000aas easy as I'd thought.  I'm quite alright now, though.  It's\u000ashocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright\u000alast night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had\u000aa small symptom of it last night already.  They must have noticed\u000ait.  I don't know why I didn't let you know at work! But you always\u000athink you can get over an illness without staying at home.  Please,\u000adon't make my parents suffer! There's no basis for any of the\u000aaccusations you're making; nobody's ever said a word to me about any\u000aof these things.  Maybe you haven't read the latest contracts I sent\u000ain.  I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well, these few\u000ahours of rest have given me strength.  You don't need to wait, sir;\u000aI'll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to\u000atell that to the boss and recommend me to him!"\u000a\u000aAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was\u000asaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers - this was\u000aeasily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in\u000abed - where he now tried to get himself upright.  He really did want\u000ato open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak\u000awith the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was\u000acurious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him.\u000aIf they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor's\u000aresponsibility and he could rest.  If, however, they took everything\u000acalmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried\u000ahe really could be at the station for eight o'clock.  The first few\u000atimes he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just\u000aslid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and\u000astood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain\u000abut he no longer gave any attention to it.  Now he let himself fall\u000aagainst the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of\u000ait with his little legs.  By now he had also calmed down, and kept\u000aquiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\u000a\u000a"Did you understand a word of all that?" the chief clerk asked his\u000aparents, "surely he's not trying to make fools of us". "Oh, God!"\u000acalled his mother, who was already in tears, "he could be seriously\u000aill and we're making him suffer.  Grete! Grete!" she then cried.\u000a"Mother?" his sister called from the other side.  They communicated\u000aacross Gregor's room.  "You'll have to go for the doctor straight\u000aaway.  Gregor is ill.  Quick, get the doctor.  Did you hear the way\u000aGregor spoke just now?"  "That was the voice of an animal", said the\u000achief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother's\u000ascreams.  "Anna! Anna!" his father called into the kitchen through\u000athe entrance hall, clapping his hands, "get a locksmith here, now!"\u000aAnd the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out\u000athrough the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they\u000awent.  How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There\u000awas no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it\u000aopen;  people often do in homes where something awful has happened.\u000a\u000aGregor, in contrast, had become much calmer.  So they couldn't\u000aunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to\u000ahim, clearer than before - perhaps his ears had become used to the\u000asound.  They had realised, though, that there was something wrong\u000awith him, and were ready to help.  The first response to his\u000asituation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel\u000abetter.  He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and\u000afrom the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising\u000aachievements - although he did not really distinguish one from the\u000aother.  Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to\u000amake his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking\u000acare to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound\u000adifferent from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure\u000ahe could judge this for himself.  Meanwhile, it had become very\u000aquiet in the next room.  Perhaps his parents were sat at the table\u000awhispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed\u000aagainst the door and listening.\u000a\u000aGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.  Once\u000athere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding\u000ahimself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his\u000alegs.  He rested there a little while to recover from the effort\u000ainvolved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the\u000alock with his mouth.  He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper\u000ateeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key? - but the lack of teeth\u000awas, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw,\u000ahe really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that\u000ahe must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came\u000afrom his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor.\u000a"Listen", said the chief clerk in the next room, "he's turning the\u000akey."  Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should\u000ahave been calling to him, his father and his mother too: "Well done,\u000aGregor", they should have cried, "keep at it, keep hold of the\u000alock!"  And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his\u000aefforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no\u000aattention to the pain he was causing himself.  As the key turned\u000around he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself\u000aupright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down\u000aagain with the whole weight of his body as needed.  The clear sound\u000aof the lock as it snapped back was Gregor's sign that he could break\u000ahis concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself:\u000a"So, I didn't need the locksmith after all". Then he lay his head on\u000athe handle of the door to open it completely.\u000a\u000aBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide\u000aopen before he could be seen.  He had first to slowly turn himself\u000aaround one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully\u000aif he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the\u000aroom.  He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to\u000apay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk\u000aexclaim a loud "Oh!", which sounded like the soughing of the wind.\u000aNow he also saw him - he was the nearest to the door - his hand\u000apressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by\u000aa steady and invisible force.  Gregor's mother, her hair still\u000adishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, looked\u000aat his father.  Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward\u000atowards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that\u000aspread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto\u000aher breast.  His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if\u000awanting to knock Gregor back into his room.  Then he looked\u000auncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands\u000aand wept so that his powerful chest shook.\u000a\u000aSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of\u000athe other door which was still held bolted in place.  In this way\u000aonly half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it\u000awhich he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others.\u000aMeanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless,\u000agrey-black building on the other side of the street - which was a\u000ahospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular\u000aline of windows piercing its facade; the rain was still\u000afalling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the\u000aground one at a time.  The washing up from breakfast lay on the\u000atable; there was so much of it because, for Gregor's father,\u000abreakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would\u000astretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of\u000adifferent newspapers.  On the wall exactly opposite there was\u000aphotograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword\u000ain his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth\u000arespect for his uniform and bearing.  The door to the entrance hall\u000awas open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could\u000asee onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down\u000abelow.\u000a\u000a"Now, then", said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to\u000ahave kept calm, "I'll get dressed straight away now, pack up my\u000asamples and set off.  Will you please just let me leave? You can\u000asee", he said to the chief clerk, "that I'm not stubborn and I\u000alike to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but\u000awithout travelling I couldn't earn my living.  So where are you\u000agoing, in to the office? Yes? Will you report everything accurately,\u000athen? It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to\u000awork, but that's just the right time to remember what's been\u000aachieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty\u000ahas been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence\u000aand concentration.  You're well aware that I'm seriously in debt to\u000aour employer as well as having to look after my parents and my\u000asister, so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but I will\u000awork my way out of it again.  Please don't make things any harder\u000afor me than they are already, and don't take sides against me at the\u000aoffice.  I know that nobody likes the travellers.  They think we\u000aearn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it.  That's\u000ajust prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of\u000ait.  But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the\u000astaff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview\u000athan the boss himself - it's very easy for a businessman like him to\u000amake mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than\u000ahe should.  And you're also well aware that we travellers spend\u000aalmost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very\u000aeasily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints,\u000aand it's almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of\u000athing, we don't usually even hear about them, or if at all it's when\u000awe arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that's when we feel\u000athe harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowing\u000awhat caused them.  Please, don't go away, at least first say\u000asomething to show that you grant that I'm at least partly right!"\u000a\u000aBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to\u000aspeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his\u000atrembling shoulders as he left.  He did not keep still for a moment\u000awhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door\u000awithout taking his eyes off him.  He moved very gradually, as if\u000athere had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.  It was\u000aonly when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden\u000amovement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in\u000aa panic.  In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards\u000athe stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force\u000awaiting to save him.\u000a\u000aGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief\u000aclerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be\u000aput into extreme danger.  That was something his parents did not\u000aunderstand very well; over the years, they had become convinced that\u000athis job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides,\u000athey had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight\u000aof any thought for the future.  Gregor, though, did think about the\u000afuture.  The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced\u000aand finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended\u000aon it! If only his sister were here! She was clever; she was already\u000ain tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back.  And\u000athe chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him;\u000ashe would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out\u000aof his shocked state.  But his sister was not there, Gregor would\u000ahave to do the job himself.  And without considering that he still\u000awas not familiar with how well he could move about in his present\u000astate, or that his speech still might not - or probably would not -\u000abe understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the\u000aopening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,\u000aridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but\u000aGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought\u000asomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.  Hardly\u000ahad that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to\u000afeel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground\u000aunder them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they\u000awere even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and\u000ahe was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at\u000aan end.  He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side\u000aas he crouched there on the floor.  His mother was not far away in\u000afront of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but\u000athen she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her\u000afingers spread shouting: "Help, for pity's sake, Help!"  The way she\u000aheld her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the\u000aunthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not;\u000ashe had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the\u000abreakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly\u000adown on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming\u000ato notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of\u000acoffee was pouring down onto the carpet.\u000a\u000a"Mother, mother", said Gregor gently, looking up at her.  He had\u000acompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not\u000ahelp himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the\u000aflow of coffee.  That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from\u000athe table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her.\u000aGregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief\u000aclerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister,\u000ahe looked back for the last time.  Gregor made a run for him; he\u000awanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have\u000aexpected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and\u000adisappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase.  The\u000aflight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor's\u000afather into a panic as well.  Until then he had been relatively self\u000acontrolled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk\u000ahimself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him,\u000aGregor's father seized the chief clerk's stick in his right hand\u000a(the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat\u000aand overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his\u000aleft, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his\u000afoot at him as he went.  Gregor's appeals to his father were of no\u000ahelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly\u000aturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.\u000aAcross the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor's mother had\u000apulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to\u000aher face.  A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards\u000athe stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table\u000afluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor.  Nothing would\u000astop Gregor's father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at\u000ahim like a wild man.  Gregor had never had any practice in moving\u000abackwards and was only able to go very slowly.  If Gregor had only\u000abeen allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room\u000astraight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that\u000ahis father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a\u000alethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father's hand\u000aany moment.  Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no\u000achoice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of\u000agoing backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as\u000apossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn\u000ahimself round.  It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able\u000ato see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact\u000anow and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a\u000adistance as to which way to turn.  If only his father would stop\u000athat unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused.  When\u000ahe had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that\u000ahissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way\u000ahe had just come.  He was pleased when he finally had his head in\u000afront of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his\u000abody was too broad to get through it without further difficulty.  In\u000ahis present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open\u000athe other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space\u000ato get through.  He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should\u000abe got back into his room as quickly as possible.  Nor would he ever\u000ahave allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation\u000afor getting through the doorway.  What he did, making more noise\u000athan ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there\u000ahad been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was\u000anow more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant\u000aexperience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without\u000aregard for what might happen.  One side of his body lifted itself,\u000ahe lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white\u000adoor and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,\u000asoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all\u000aby himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air\u000awhile those on the other side were pressed painfully against the\u000aground.  Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which\u000areleased him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily\u000ableeding, deep into his room.  The door was slammed shut with the\u000astick, then, finally, all was quiet.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aII\u000a\u000a\u000aIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke\u000afrom his deep and coma-like sleep.  He would have woken soon\u000aafterwards anyway even if he hadn't been disturbed, as he had had\u000aenough sleep and felt fully rested.  But he had the impression that\u000asome hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front\u000aroom being carefully shut had woken him.  The light from the\u000aelectric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling\u000aand tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was\u000adark.  He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily\u000awith his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value\u000a- in order to see what had been happening there.  The whole of his\u000aleft side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar,  and he limped\u000abadly on his two rows of legs.  One of the legs had been badly\u000ainjured in the events of that morning - it was nearly a miracle that\u000aonly one of them had been - and dragged along lifelessly.\u000a\u000aIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it\u000aactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of\u000asomething to eat.  By the door there was a dish filled with\u000asweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it.  He\u000awas so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he\u000ahad been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the\u000amilk, nearly covering his eyes with it.  But he soon drew his head\u000aback again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender\u000aleft side make it difficult to eat the food - he was only able to\u000aeat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but the\u000amilk did not taste at all nice.  Milk like this was normally his\u000afavourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for him\u000abecause of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, away\u000afrom the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.\u000a\u000aThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had\u000abeen lit in the living room.  His father at this time would normally\u000abe sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to\u000aGregor's mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not\u000aa sound to be heard.  Gregor's sister would often write and tell him\u000aabout this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in\u000arecent times.  It was so quiet all around too, even though there\u000amust have been somebody in the flat.  "What a quiet life it is the\u000afamily lead", said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness,\u000afelt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in\u000asuch a nice home for his sister and parents.  But what now, if all\u000athis peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and\u000afrightening end? That was something that Gregor did not want to\u000athink about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and\u000adown the room.\u000a\u000aOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was\u000aopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door\u000aon the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to\u000aenter the room but thought better of it.  Gregor went and waited\u000aimmediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous\u000avisitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it\u000awas; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in\u000avain.  The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had\u000awanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up\u000aone of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time\u000aduring the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.\u000a\u000aIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room\u000awas put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had\u000astayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as\u000athey went away together on tip-toe.  It was clear that no-one would\u000acome into Gregor's room any more until morning; that gave him plenty\u000aof time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange\u000ahis life.  For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced\u000ato remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor,\u000aeven though he had been living in it for five years.  Hardly aware\u000aof what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he\u000ahurried under the couch.  It pressed down on his back a little, and\u000ahe was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless felt\u000aimmediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too\u000abroad to get it all underneath.\u000a\u000aHe spent the whole night there.  Some of the time he passed in a\u000alight sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of\u000ahis hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague\u000ahopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the\u000atime being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the\u000agreatest consideration so that his family could bear the\u000aunpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to\u000aimpose on them.\u000a\u000aGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his\u000adecisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had\u000aended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the\u000afront room and looked anxiously in.  She did not see him straight\u000aaway, but when she did notice him under the couch - he had to be\u000asomewhere, for God's sake, he couldn't have flown away - she was so\u000ashocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut\u000aagain from outside.  But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she\u000aopened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if\u000aentering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.\u000aGregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch,\u000aand watched her.  Would she notice that he had left the milk as it\u000awas, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him\u000ain some other food that was more suitable? If she didn't do it\u000aherself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,\u000aalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the\u000acouch, throw himself at his sister's feet and beg her for something\u000agood to eat.  However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately\u000aand looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with\u000asome surprise.  She immediately picked it up - using a rag,\u000anot her bare hands - and carried it out.  Gregor was extremely\u000acurious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the\u000awildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his\u000asister, in her goodness, actually did bring.  In order to test his\u000ataste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out\u000aon an old newspaper.  There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones\u000afrom the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a\u000afew raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared\u000ainedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with\u000abutter and salt.  As well as all that she had poured some water into\u000athe dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor's\u000ause, and placed it beside them.  Then, out of consideration for\u000aGregor's feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of\u000aher, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so\u000athat Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for\u000ahimself as he liked.  Gregor's little legs whirred, at last he could\u000aeat.  What's more, his injuries must already have completely healed\u000aas he found no difficulty in moving.  This amazed him, as more than\u000aa month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he\u000athought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.\u000a"Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?", he thought, and was\u000aalready sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost\u000acompellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the\u000anewspaper.  Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with\u000apleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the\u000afresh foods, on the other hand, he didn't like at all, and even\u000adragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them\u000abecause he couldn't stand the smell.  Long after he had finished\u000aeating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned\u000athe key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw.  He\u000awas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he\u000ahurried back under the couch.  But he needed great self-control to\u000astay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room,\u000aas eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he\u000acould hardly breathe in that narrow space.  Half suffocating, he\u000awatched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a\u000abroom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he\u000ahad not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more.\u000aShe quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden\u000alid, and carried everything out.  She had hardly turned her back\u000abefore Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched\u000ahimself.\u000a\u000aThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the\u000amorning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the\u000asecond time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his\u000aparents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor's\u000asister would send the maid away on some errand.  Gregor's father and\u000amother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it\u000awould have been more than they could stand to have any more\u000aexperience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his\u000asister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were\u000aindeed suffering enough.\u000a\u000aIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the\u000adoctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the\u000aflat.  As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister,\u000athought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to\u000ahear his sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about\u000ahis room.  It was only later, when she had become a little more used\u000ato everything - there was, of course, no question of her ever\u000abecoming fully used to the situation - that Gregor would sometimes\u000acatch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be\u000aconstrued as friendly.  "He's enjoyed his dinner today", she might\u000asay when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him,\u000aor if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more\u000afrequent, she would often say, sadly, "now everything's just been\u000aleft there again".\u000a\u000aAlthough Gregor wasn't able to hear any news directly he did listen\u000ato much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard\u000aanyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and\u000apress his whole body against it.  There was seldom any conversation,\u000aespecially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if\u000aonly in secret.  For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime\u000awas about what they should do now; but even between meals they spoke\u000aabout the same subject as there were always at least two members of\u000athe family at home - nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and\u000ait was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty.  And on\u000athe very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged\u000aGregor's mother to let her go without delay.  It was not very clear\u000ahow much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter\u000aof an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor's mother for her dismissal as\u000aif she had done her an enormous service.  She even swore\u000aemphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had\u000ahappened, even though no-one had asked that of her.\u000a\u000aNow Gregor's sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;\u000aalthough that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much.\u000aGregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another\u000ato eat, and receive no more answer than "no thanks, I've had enough"\u000aor something similar.  No-one drank very much either.  His sister\u000awould sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping\u000afor the chance to go and fetch it herself.  When his father then\u000asaid nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that\u000ashe could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father would\u000aclose the matter with a big, loud "No", and no more would be said.\u000a\u000aEven before the first day had come to an end, his father had\u000aexplained to Gregor's mother and sister what their finances and\u000aprospects were.  Now and then he stood up from the table and took\u000asome receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from\u000ahis business when it had collapsed five years earlier.  Gregor heard\u000ahow he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he\u000ahad taken the item he wanted.  What he heard his father say was some\u000aof the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been\u000aincarcerated in his room.  He had thought that nothing at all\u000aremained from his father's business, at least he had never told him\u000aanything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway.\u000aTheir business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total\u000adespair, and Gregor's only concern at that time had been to arrange\u000athings so that they could all forget about it as quickly as\u000apossible.  So then he started working especially hard, with a fiery\u000avigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling\u000arepresentative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn\u000amoney in quite different ways.  Gregor converted his success at work\u000astraight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the\u000abenefit of his astonished and delighted family.  They had been good\u000atimes and they had never come again, at least not with the same\u000asplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was\u000ain a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear\u000athem.  They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family,\u000athey took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it,\u000aalthough there was no longer much warm affection given in return.\u000aGregor only remained close to his sister now.  Unlike him, she was\u000avery fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his\u000asecret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it\u000awould cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some\u000aother way.  During Gregor's short periods in town, conversation with\u000ahis sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever\u000amentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised.  Their\u000aparents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought\u000aabout it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he\u000aplanned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.\u000a\u000aThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his\u000amind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and\u000alistening.  There were times when he simply became too tired to\u000acontinue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the\u000adoor and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the\u000aslightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would\u000aall go silent.  "What's that he's doing now", his father would say\u000aafter a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then\u000awould the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.\u000a\u000aWhen explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,\u000apartly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with\u000athese matters himself and partly because Gregor's mother did not\u000aunderstand everything the first time.  From these repeated explanations\u000aGregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes\u000athere was still some money available from the old days.  It was not\u000aa lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest\u000ahad accumulated.  Besides that, they had not been using up all the\u000amoney that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a\u000alittle for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating.\u000aBehind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at\u000athis unexpected thrift and caution.  He could actually have used\u000athis surplus money to reduce his father's debt to his boss, and the\u000aday when he could have freed himself from that job would have come\u000amuch closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had\u000adone things.\u000a\u000aThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family\u000ato live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for,\u000aperhaps, one or two years, no more.  That's to say, it was money\u000athat should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies;\u000amoney to live on had to be earned.  His father was healthy but old,\u000aand lacking in self confidence.  During the five years that he had\u000anot been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full of\u000astrain and no success - he had put on a lot of weight and become\u000avery slow and clumsy.  Would Gregor's elderly mother now have to go\u000aand earn money? She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her\u000ajust to move about the home, every other day would be spent\u000astruggling for breath on the sofa by the open window.  Would his\u000asister have to go and earn money? She was still a child of\u000aseventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting\u000aof wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business,\u000ajoining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the\u000aviolin.  Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money,\u000aGregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself\u000aonto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with\u000ashame and regret.\u000a\u000aHe would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a\u000awink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.  Or he might go\u000ato all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto\u000athe sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to\u000astare out of it.  He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from\u000adoing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered\u000athan experienced,  as what he actually saw in this way was becoming\u000aless distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had\u000aused to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the\u000astreet, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known\u000athat he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite\u000abeing in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was\u000alooking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the\u000agrey earth mingled inseparably.  His observant sister only needed to\u000anotice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its\u000aexact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and\u000aeven left the inner pane of the window open from then on.\u000a\u000aIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her\u000afor all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him\u000ato bear it; but as it was it caused him pain.  His sister,\u000anaturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing\u000aburdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the\u000abetter she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also\u000aable to see through it all so much better.  It had even become very\u000aunpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room.  No sooner\u000ahad she come in than she would quickly close the door as a\u000aprecaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into\u000aGregor's room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it\u000ahurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating.  Even if it was\u000acold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little\u000awhile.  She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about\u000aand noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole\u000awhile, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to\u000aspare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the\u000asame room with him with the windows closed.\u000a\u000aOne day, about a month after Gregor's transformation when his sister\u000ano longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance,\u000ashe came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him\u000astill staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be\u000amost horrible.  In itself, his sister's not coming into the room\u000awould have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been\u000adifficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still\u000athere, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and\u000aclosed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had\u000athreatened her and tried to bite her.  Gregor went straight to hide\u000ahimself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until midday\u000abefore his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than\u000ausual.  It made him realise that she still found his appearance\u000aunbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to\u000aovercome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that\u000aprotruded from under the couch.  One day, in order to spare her even\u000athis sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the\u000acouch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered\u000aand his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down.\u000aIf she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do\u000awas take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no\u000apleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely.  She left the\u000asheet where it was.  Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of\u000agratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet\u000ato see how his sister liked the new arrangement.\u000a\u000aFor the first fourteen days, Gregor's parents could not bring\u000athemselves to come into the room to see him.  He would often hear\u000athem say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing\u000aeven though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat\u000auseless and frequently been annoyed with her.  But now the two of\u000athem, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of\u000aGregor's room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as\u000ashe went out again she would have to tell them exactly how\u000aeverything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this\u000atime and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen.\u000aHis mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but\u000ahis father and sister at first persuaded her against it.  Gregor\u000alistened very closely to all this, and approved fully.  Later,\u000athough, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out:\u000a"Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son! Can't you\u000aunderstand I have to see him?", and Gregor would think to himself\u000athat maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day\u000aof course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand\u000aeverything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was\u000astill just a child after all, and really might not have had an\u000aadult's appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.\u000a\u000aGregor's wish to see his mother was soon realised.  Out of\u000aconsideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at\u000athe window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did\u000anot give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie\u000aquietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any\u000apleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit\u000aof crawling up and down the walls and ceiling.  He was especially\u000afond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying\u000aon the floor; he could breathe more freely; his body had a light\u000aswing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happen\u000athat he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and\u000alanding on the floor with a crash.  But now, of course, he had far\u000abetter control of his body than before and, even with a fall as\u000agreat as that, caused himself no damage.  Very soon his sister\u000anoticed Gregor's new way of entertaining himself - he had, after\u000aall, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about -\u000aand got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by\u000aremoving the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of\u000adrawers and the desk.  Now, this was not something that she would be\u000aable to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her\u000afather; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the\u000acook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she\u000ahad even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times\u000aand never to have to open the door unless it was especially\u000aimportant; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when\u000aGregor's father was not there and fetch his mother to help her.  As\u000ashe approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her\u000ajoy, but once at the door she went silent.  First, of course, his\u000asister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room\u000awas alright; and only then did she let her mother enter.  Gregor had\u000ahurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more\u000afolds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just\u000abeen thrown down by chance.  Gregor also refrained, this time, from\u000aspying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his\u000amother until later and was simply glad that she had come.  "You can\u000acome in, he can't be seen", said his sister, obviously leading her\u000ain by the hand.  The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair\u000aof feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they\u000apushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest\u000apart of the work for herself and ignoring her mother's warnings that\u000ashe would strain herself.  This lasted a very long time.  After\u000alabouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would\u000abe better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was too\u000aheavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor's father got\u000ahome and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way\u000aeven more, and for another thing it wasn't even sure that taking the\u000afurniture away would really be any help to him.  She thought just\u000athe opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her\u000aheart; and why wouldn't Gregor feel the same way about it, he'd been\u000aused to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make\u000ahim feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that.  Then, quietly,\u000aalmost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did\u000anot know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she was\u000aconvinced that he did not understand her words, she added "and by\u000ataking the furniture away, won't it seem like we're showing that\u000awe've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning him to\u000acope for himself? I think it'd be best to leave the room exactly the\u000away it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he'll\u000afind everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time in\u000abetween all the easier".\u000a\u000aHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the\u000alack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous\u000alife led by the family during these two months, must have made him\u000aconfused - he could think of no other way of explaining to himself\u000awhy he had seriously wanted his room emptied out.  Had he really\u000awanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out\u000awith the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him\u000acrawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let\u000ahim quickly forget his past when he had still been human.  He had\u000acome very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his\u000amother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it.  Nothing\u000ashould be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without\u000athe good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the\u000afurniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that\u000awas not a loss but a great advantage.\u000a\u000aHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the\u000aidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor's spokesman to his\u000aparents about the things that concerned him.  This meant that his\u000amother's advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on\u000aremoving not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had\u000athought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important\u000acouch.  It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the\u000aunexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her\u000ainsist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to\u000acrawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see,\u000awas of no use to him at all.  Girls of that age, though, do become\u000aenthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever\u000athey can.  Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor's\u000asituation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do\u000aeven more for him.  Grete would probably be the only one who would\u000adare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls\u000aby himself.\u000a\u000aSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her.  Gregor's mother\u000aalready looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and\u000ahelped Gregor's sister to get the chest of drawers out with what\u000astrength she had.  The chest of drawers was something that Gregor\u000acould do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay.\u000aHardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out\u000aof the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to\u000asee what he could do about it.  He meant to be as careful and\u000aconsiderate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who\u000acame back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the\u000achest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself\u000awithout, of course, moving it an inch.  His mother was not used to\u000athe sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurried\u000abackwards to the far end of the couch.  In his startlement, though,\u000ahe was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a\u000alittle.  It was enough to attract his mother's attention.  She stood\u000avery still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to\u000aGrete.\u000a\u000aGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was\u000ahappening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after\u000aall, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their\u000alittle calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the\u000afloor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed\u000afrom all sides.  With his head and legs pulled in against him and\u000ahis body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself\u000athat he could not stand all of this much longer.  They were emptying\u000ahis room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they had\u000aalready taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools;\u000anow they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place\u000aclearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework\u000aas a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at\u000ainfant school--he really could not wait any longer to see whether\u000athe two women's intentions were good.  He had nearly forgotten they\u000awere there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while\u000athey worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped\u000aheavily on the floor.\u000a\u000aSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room\u000acatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times\u000anot knowing what he should save first before his attention was\u000asuddenly caught by the picture on the wall - which was already\u000adenuded of everything else that had been on it - of the lady dressed\u000ain copious fur.  He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself\u000aagainst its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot\u000abelly.  This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would\u000acertainly be taken away by no-one.  He turned his head to face the\u000adoor into the living room so that he could watch the women when they\u000acame back.\u000a\u000aThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite\u000asoon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly\u000acarrying her.  "What shall we take now, then?", said Grete and\u000alooked around.  Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall.  Perhaps\u000aonly because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face\u000ato her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly\u000aand with a tremor in her voice: "Come on, let's go back in the\u000aliving room for a while?"  Gregor could see what Grete had in mind,\u000ashe wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down\u000afrom the wall.  Well, she could certainly try it! He sat unyielding\u000aon his picture.  He would rather jump at Grete's face.\u000a\u000aBut Grete's words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to\u000aone side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the\u000awallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw\u000ascreamed: "Oh God, oh God!"  Arms outstretched, she fell onto the\u000acouch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile.\u000a"Gregor!" shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist.\u000a That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his\u000atransformation.  She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of\u000asmelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted\u000ato help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuck\u000afast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he,\u000atoo, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in\u000athe old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she\u000awas looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned\u000around; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut\u000aGregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him;\u000anow, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles\u000ashe could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door\u000ashut with her foot.  So now Gregor was shut out from his mother,\u000awho, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the\u000adoor if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to\u000astay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and,\u000aoppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,\u000ahe crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally\u000ain his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell\u000adown into the middle of the dinner table.\u000a\u000aHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was\u000aquiet, maybe that was a good sign.  Then there was someone at the\u000adoor.  The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so\u000athat Grete would have to go and answer it.  His father had arrived\u000ahome.  "What's happened?" were his first words; Grete's appearance\u000amust have made everything clear to him.  She answered him with\u000asubdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: "Mother's\u000afainted, but she's better now.  Gregor got out."  "Just as I\u000aexpected", said his father, "just as I always said, but you women\u000awouldn't listen, would you."  It was clear to Gregor that Grete had\u000anot said enough and that his father took it to mean that something\u000abad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence.\u000aThat meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he\u000adid not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been\u000apossible.  So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself\u000aagainst it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could\u000asee straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go\u000aback into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary to\u000adrive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would\u000adisappear.\u000a\u000aHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like\u000athat; "Ah!", he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both\u000aangry and glad at the same time.  Gregor drew his head back from the\u000adoor and lifted it towards his father.  He really had not imagined\u000ahis father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit\u000aof crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what was\u000agoing on the rest of the flat the way he had done before.  He really\u000aought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was\u000athat really his father? The same tired man as used to be laying\u000athere entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business\u000atrips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his\u000anightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly even\u000aable to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise\u000ahis arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a\u000awalk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in\u000ahis overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his\u000away forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking\u000aslowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and,\u000aif he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his\u000acompanions around him.  He was standing up straight enough now;\u000adressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by\u000athe employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar\u000aof the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy\u000aeyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his\u000anormally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his\u000ascalp.  He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some\u000abank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa,\u000aput his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his\u000along uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards\u000aGregor.  He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind,\u000abut nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high.  Gregor was amazed\u000aat the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time\u000awith that - he knew full well, right from the first day of his new\u000alife, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely\u000astrict with him.  And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his\u000afather stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even\u000aslightly.  In this way they went round the room several times\u000awithout anything decisive happening, without even giving the\u000aimpression of a chase as everything went so slowly.  Gregor remained\u000aall this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father\u000amight see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or\u000aceiling.  Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly\u000awould not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for\u000aeach step his father took he had to carry out countless movements.\u000aHe became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his\u000alungs had not been very reliable.  Now, as he lurched about in his\u000aefforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could\u000ahardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him to\u000athink of any other way of saving himself than running; he almost\u000aforgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, they\u000awere concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and\u000aprotrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew\u000adown and rolled in front of him.  It was an apple; then another one\u000aimmediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longer\u000aany point in running as his father had decided to bombard him.  He\u000ahad filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and\u000anow, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple\u000aafter another.  These little, red apples rolled about on the floor,\u000aknocking into each other as if they had electric motors.  An apple\u000athrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid off\u000awithout doing any harm.  Another one however, immediately following\u000ait, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag\u000ahimself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible\u000apain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot\u000aand spread himself out, all his senses in confusion.  The last thing\u000ahe saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was\u000ascreaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his\u000asister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to\u000amake it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, her\u000askirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground,\u000astumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her arms\u000aaround him, uniting herself with him totally - now Gregor lost his\u000aability to see anything - her hands behind his father's head begging\u000ahim to spare Gregor's life.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIII\u000a\u000a\u000aNo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor's flesh, so it\u000aremained there as a visible reminder of his injury.  He had suffered\u000ait there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious\u000aenough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current\u000asad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated\u000aas an enemy.  On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to\u000aswallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\u000a\u000aBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility -\u000aprobably permanently.  He had been reduced to the condition of an\u000aancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across\u000ahis room - crawling over the ceiling was out of the question - but\u000athis deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) made\u000aup for by the door to the living room being left open every evening.\u000a He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours\u000abefore it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his room\u000awhere he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch the\u000afamily in the light of the dinner table and listen to their\u000aconversation - with everyone's permission, in a way, and thus quite\u000adifferently from before.\u000a\u000aThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of\u000acourse, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when\u000ahe was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room.\u000a All of them were usually very quiet nowadays.  Soon after dinner,\u000ahis father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister\u000awould urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the\u000alamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who\u000ahad taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings\u000aso that she might be able to get a better position later on.\u000aSometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother\u000a"you're doing so much sewing again today!", as if he did not know\u000athat he had been dozing - and then he would go back to sleep again\u000awhile mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.\u000a\u000aWith a kind of stubbornness, Gregor's father refused to take his\u000auniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg\u000aGregor's father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if\u000aalways ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his\u000asuperior even here.  The uniform had not been new to start with, but\u000aas a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the\u000aefforts of Gregor's mother and sister to look after it.  Gregor\u000awould often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on\u000athis coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny,\u000awhile the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but\u000apeaceful.\u000a\u000aAs soon as it struck ten, Gregor's mother would speak gently to his\u000afather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he\u000acouldn't sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his\u000asleep if he was to be up at six to get to work.  But since he had\u000abeen in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on\u000astaying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep\u000aand it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the\u000achair for his bed.  Then, however much mother and sister would\u000aimportune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep\u000aslowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes\u000aclosed and refusing to get up.  Gregor's mother would tug at his\u000asleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor's sister would\u000aleave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect\u000aon him.  He would just sink deeper into his chair.  Only when the\u000atwo women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes,\u000alook at them one after the other and say: "What a life! This is what\u000apeace I get in my old age!"  And supported by the two women he would\u000alift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load\u000ahimself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry\u000aon by himself while Gregor's mother would throw down her needle and\u000ahis sister her pen so that they could run after his father and\u000acontinue being of help to him.\u000a\u000aWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to\u000agive more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The\u000ahousehold budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed;\u000aan enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped\u000aaround her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest\u000awork; everything else was looked after by Gregor's mother on top of\u000athe large amount of sewing work she did.  Gregor even learned,\u000alistening to the evening conversation about what price they had\u000ahoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family\u000ahad been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond\u000aof wearing them at functions and celebrations.  But the loudest\u000acomplaint was that although the flat was much too big for their\u000apresent circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no\u000aimaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address.  He could\u000asee quite well, though, that there were more reasons than\u000aconsideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it\u000awould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate\u000awith a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back\u000afrom their decision to move was much more to do with their total\u000adespair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune\u000aunlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related\u000ato.  They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects\u000afrom poor people, Gregor's father brought bank employees their\u000abreakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for\u000astrangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the\u000abehest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to\u000ado any more.  And the injury in Gregor's back began to hurt as much\u000aas when it was new.  After they had come back from taking his father\u000ato bed Gregor's mother and sister would now leave their work where\u000ait was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would\u000apoint to Gregor's room and say "Close that door, Grete", and then,\u000awhen he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and\u000atheir tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring\u000adry-eyed at the table.\u000a\u000aGregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.  Sometimes he would\u000athink of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, the\u000anext time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss\u000aand the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts,\u000athe salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three\u000afriends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a\u000aprovincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared\u000aagain, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been\u000aserious but too slow, - all of them appeared to him, mixed together\u000awith strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping\u000ahim and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was\u000aglad when they disappeared.  Other times he was not at all in the\u000amood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about\u000athe lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think of\u000anothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get into\u000athe pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to,\u000aeven if he was not hungry.  Gregor's sister no longer thought about\u000ahow she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other\u000ainto his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the\u000amorning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away\u000aagain with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or\u000a- more often than not - had been left totally untouched.  She still\u000acleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been\u000aany quicker about it.  Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here\u000aand there were little balls of dust and filth.  At first, Gregor\u000awent into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived\u000aas a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks\u000awithout his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt\u000aas well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it.\u000aAt the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for\u000aher and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning up\u000aGregor's room was for her and her alone.  Gregor's mother did once\u000athoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of\u000awater to do it - although that much dampness also made Gregor ill\u000aand he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile.  But his mother\u000awas to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had\u000ahis sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change\u000ain Gregor's room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living\u000aroom where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she\u000abroke into convulsive tears.  Her father, of course, was startled\u000aout of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and\u000ahelpless; then they, too, became agitated; Gregor's father, standing\u000ato the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning\u000aof Gregor's room to his sister; from her left, Gregor's sister\u000ascreamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor's room again;\u000awhile his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself\u000awith anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears,\u000athumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in\u000aanger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him\u000athe sight of this and all its noise.\u000a\u000aGregor's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking\u000aafter Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but\u000aeven so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place.\u000aGregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected.  Now, though,\u000athe charwoman was here.  This elderly widow, with a robust bone\u000astructure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in\u000aher long life, wasn't really repelled by Gregor.  Just by chance one\u000aday, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor's\u000aroom and found herself face to face with him.  He was taken totally\u000aby surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro\u000awhile she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in\u000afront of her.  From then on she never failed to open the door\u000aslightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him.  At\u000afirst she would call to him as she did so with words that she\u000aprobably considered friendly, such as "come on then, you old\u000adung-beetle!", or "look at the old dung-beetle there!"  Gregor never\u000aresponded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where he\u000awas without moving as if the door had never even been opened.  If\u000aonly they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day\u000ainstead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt\u000alike it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\u000awindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to\u000aspeak to him in that way once again.  Gregor was so resentful of it\u000athat he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it\u000awas like a kind of attack.  Instead of being afraid, the charwoman\u000ajust lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there\u000awith her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until\u000athe chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor's back.\u000a"Aren't you coming any closer, then?", she asked when Gregor turned\u000around again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.\u000a\u000aGregor had almost entirely stopped eating.  Only if he happened to\u000afind himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he\u000amight take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there\u000aa few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again.  At\u000afirst he thought it was distress at the state of his room that\u000astopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made\u000athere.  They had got into the habit of putting things into this room\u000athat they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many\u000asuch things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to\u000athree gentlemen.  These earnest gentlemen - all three of them had\u000afull beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door\u000aone day - were painfully insistent on things' being tidy.  This\u000ameant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in\u000athis establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the\u000akitchen.  Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate,\u000aespecially if it was dirty.  They had moreover brought most of their\u000aown furnishings and equipment with them.  For this reason, many\u000athings had become superfluous which, although they could not be\u000asold, the family did not wish to discard.  All these things found\u000atheir way into Gregor's room.  The dustbins from the kitchen found\u000atheir way in there too.  The charwoman was always in a hurry, and\u000aanything she couldn't use for the time being she would just chuck in\u000athere.  He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object\u000aand the hand that held it.  The woman most likely meant to fetch the\u000athings back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to\u000athrow everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that\u000athey were left where they landed when they had first been thrown\u000aunless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere\u000aelse.  At first he moved it because, with no other room free where\u000ahe could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to\u000aenjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to\u000adeath, and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.\u000a\u000aThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening\u000ameal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so\u000athe door to this room was often kept closed in the evening.  But\u000aGregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after\u000aall, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without\u000athe family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest\u000acorner.  One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living\u000aroom slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who\u000arented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on.\u000aThey sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals\u000awith his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and picked\u000aup their knives and forks.  Gregor's mother immediately appeared in\u000athe doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister\u000awith a dish piled high with potatoes.  The food was steaming, and\u000afilled the room with its smell.  The gentlemen bent over the dishes\u000aset in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before\u000aeating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as\u000aan authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat\u000awhile it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether\u000ait was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the\u000akitchen.  It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor's mother and\u000asister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again\u000aand smiled.\u000a\u000aThe family themselves ate in the kitchen.  Nonetheless, Gregor's\u000afather came into the living room before he went into the kitchen,\u000abowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table.\u000aThe gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards.\u000a Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence.  It\u000aseemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of\u000aeating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had\u000awanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was\u000anot possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless\u000ahowever nice they might be.  "I'd like to eat something", said\u000aGregor anxiously, "but not anything like they're eating.  They do\u000afeed themselves.  And here I am, dying!"\u000a\u000aThroughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the\u000aviolin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the\u000akitchen.  The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the\u000aone in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of\u000athe others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and\u000asmoking.  When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood\u000aup and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they\u000astood pressed against each other.  Someone must have heard them in\u000athe kitchen, as Gregor's father called out: "Is the playing perhaps\u000aunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away."  "On\u000athe contrary", said the middle gentleman, "would the young lady not\u000alike to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after\u000aall, much more cosy and comfortable?"  "Oh yes, we'd love to",\u000acalled back Gregor's father as if he had been the violin player\u000ahimself.  The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.\u000aGregor's father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with\u000athe music and his sister with the violin.  She calmly prepared\u000aeverything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never\u000arented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated\u000acourtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on\u000atheir own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right\u000ahand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother,\u000athough, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving\u000athe chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it - out of\u000athe way in a corner.\u000a\u000aHis sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention,\u000aone on each side, to the movements of her hands.  Drawn in by the\u000aplaying, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had\u000ahis head in the living room.  Before, he had taken great pride in\u000ahow considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had\u000abecome so thoughtless about the others.  What's more, there was now\u000aall the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the\u000adust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest\u000amovement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on\u000ahis back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now to\u000alay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to\u000ado several times a day.  And despite this condition, he was not too\u000ashy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living\u000aroom.\u000a\u000aNo-one noticed him, though.  The family was totally preoccupied with\u000athe violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their\u000ahands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music\u000astand to look at all the notes being played, and they must have\u000adisturbed Gregor's sister, but soon, in contrast with the family,\u000athey  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking\u000ato each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while\u000aGregor's father observed them anxiously.  It really now seemed very\u000aobvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or\u000aentertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had\u000ahad enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of\u000apoliteness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed.  It was\u000aespecially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their\u000acigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses.  Yet Gregor's sister\u000awas playing so beautifully.  Her face was leant to one side,\u000afollowing the lines of music with a careful and melancholy\u000aexpression.  Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his\u000ahead close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the\u000achance came.  Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It\u000aseemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown\u000anourishment he had been yearning for.  He was determined to make his\u000away forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might\u000acome into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her\u000aplaying here as much as he would.  He never wanted to let her out of\u000ahis room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance\u000ashould, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every\u000adoor of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his\u000asister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of\u000aher own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her\u000aear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to\u000asend her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about\u000ait last Christmas - had Christmas really come and gone already? - if\u000athis misfortune hadn't got in the way, and refuse to let anyone\u000adissuade him from it.  On hearing all this, his sister would break\u000aout in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder\u000aand kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she\u000ahad kept free without any necklace or collar.\u000a\u000a"Mr. Samsa!", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor's father,\u000apointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at\u000aGregor as he slowly moved forward.  The violin went silent, the\u000amiddle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends,\u000ashaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor.  His father seemed\u000ato think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before\u000adriving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and\u000aseemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing\u000ahad been.  He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and\u000aattempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as\u000atrying to block their view of Gregor with his body.  Now they did\u000abecome a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his\u000afather's behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that\u000athey had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without\u000aknowing it.  They asked Gregor's father for explanations, raised\u000atheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved\u000aback towards their room only very slowly.  Meanwhile Gregor's sister\u000ahad overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was\u000asuddenly interrupted.  She had let her hands drop and let violin and\u000abow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if\u000astill playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay\u000athe instrument on her mother's lap who still sat laboriously\u000astruggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room\u000awhich, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more\u000aquickly moving toward.  Under his sister's experienced hand, the\u000apillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and\u000ashe had already finished making the beds and slipped out again\u000abefore the three gentlemen had reached the room.  Gregor's father\u000aseemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the\u000arespect he owed to his tenants.  He urged them and pressed them\u000auntil, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of\u000athe three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and\u000athereby brought Gregor's father to a halt.  "I declare here and\u000anow", he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor's mother and\u000asister to gain their attention too, "that with regard to the\u000arepugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family"\u000a- here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor - "I give\u000aimmediate notice on my room.  For the days that I have been living\u000ahere I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will\u000aconsider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages\u000afrom you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the\u000agrounds for such an action."  He was silent and looked straight\u000aahead as if waiting for something.  And indeed, his two friends\u000ajoined in with the words: "And we also give immediate notice."  With\u000athat, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.\u000a\u000aGregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his\u000ahands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself\u000aout for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head\u000akept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all.\u000aThroughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen\u000ahad first seen him.  His disappointment at the failure of his plan,\u000aand perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible\u000afor him to move.  He was sure that everyone would turn on him any\u000amoment, and he waited.  He was not even startled out of this state\u000awhen the violin on his mother's lap fell from her trembling fingers\u000aand landed loudly on the floor.\u000a\u000a"Father, Mother", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand\u000aas introduction, "we can't carry on like this.  Maybe you can't see\u000ait, but I can.  I don't want to call this monster my brother, all I\u000acan say is: we have to try and get rid of it.  We've done all that's\u000ahumanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don't think\u000aanyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong."\u000a\u000a"She's absolutely right", said Gregor's father to himself.  His\u000amother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to\u000acough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged\u000aexpression in her eyes.\u000a\u000aGregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her\u000aforehead.  Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some more\u000adefinite ideas.  He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between\u000athe plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and\u000aoccasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile.\u000a\u000a"We have to try and get rid of it", said Gregor's sister, now\u000aspeaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with\u000acoughing to listen, "it'll be the death of both of you, I can see it\u000acoming.  We can't all work as hard as we have to and then come home\u000ato be tortured like this, we can't endure it.  I can't endure it any\u000amore."  And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down\u000athe face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand\u000amovements.\u000a\u000a"My child", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,\u000a"what are we to do?"\u000a\u000aHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness\u000aand tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier\u000acertainty.\u000a\u000a"If he could just understand us", said his father almost as a\u000aquestion; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as\u000aa sign that of that there was no question.\u000a\u000a"If he could just understand us", repeated Gregor's father, closing\u000ahis eyes in acceptance of his sister's certainty that that was quite\u000aimpossible, "then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement\u000awith him.  But as it is ..."\u000a\u000a"It's got to go", shouted his sister, "that's the only way, Father.\u000aYou've got to get rid of the idea that that's Gregor.  We've only\u000aharmed ourselves by believing it for so long.  How can that be\u000aGregor? If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it's not\u000apossible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he\u000awould have gone of his own free will.  We wouldn't have a brother\u000aany more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember\u000ahim with respect.  As it is this animal is persecuting us, it's\u000adriven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole\u000aflat and force us to sleep on the streets.  Father, look, just\u000alook", she suddenly screamed, "he's starting again!"   In her alarm,\u000awhich was totally beyond Gregor's comprehension, his sister even\u000aabandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her\u000achair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay\u000aanywhere near Gregor.  She rushed over to behind her father, who had\u000abecome excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his\u000ahands in front of Gregor's sister as if to protect her.\u000a\u000aBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all\u000ahis sister.  All he had done was begin to turn round so that he\u000acould go back into his room, although that was in itself quite\u000astartling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round\u000arequired a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help\u000ahimself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the\u000afloor.  He stopped and looked round.  They seemed to have realised\u000ahis good intention and had only been alarmed briefly.  Now they all\u000alooked at him in unhappy silence.  His mother lay in her chair with\u000aher legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes\u000anearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father\u000awith her arms around his neck.\u000a\u000a"Maybe now they'll let me turn round", thought Gregor and went back\u000ato work.  He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had\u000asometimes to stop and take a rest.  No-one was making him rush any\u000amore, everything was left up to him.  As soon as he had finally\u000afinished turning round he began to move straight ahead.  He was\u000aamazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and\u000acould not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak\u000astate a little while before and almost without noticing it.  He\u000aconcentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that\u000athere was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him.\u000aHe did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.  He did\u000anot turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff,\u000abut it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had\u000achanged, only his sister had stood up.  With his last glance he saw\u000athat his mother had now fallen completely asleep.\u000a\u000aHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,\u000abolted and locked.  The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him\u000athat his little legs collapsed under him.  It was his sister who had\u000abeen in so much of a rush.  She had been standing there waiting and\u000asprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and\u000aas she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents "At\u000alast!".\u000a\u000a"What now, then?", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the\u000adarkness.  He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move\u000aat all.  This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being\u000aable to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then\u000awas unnatural.  He also felt relatively comfortable.  It is true\u000athat his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly\u000agetting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.\u000aHe could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the\u000ainflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust.\u000aHe thought back of his family with emotion and love.  If it was\u000apossible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his\u000asister.  He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination\u000auntil he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning.  He\u000awatched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the\u000awindow too.  Then, without his willing it, his head sank down\u000acompletely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.\u000a\u000aWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often asked\u000aher not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her\u000ahurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd\u000aarrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - she\u000amade her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing\u000aspecial.  She thought he was laying there so still on purpose,\u000aplaying the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to\u000ahim.  She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she\u000atried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway.  When she had no\u000asuccess with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked\u000aat him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across\u000athe floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention.\u000aShe soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide,\u000awhistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom\u000adoors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: "Come and\u000a'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!"\u000a\u000aMr. and  Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had\u000ato make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before\u000athey could grasp what she was saying.  But then, each from his own\u000aside, they hurried out of bed.  Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his\u000ashoulders,  Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is\u000ahow they went into Gregor's room.  On the way they opened the door\u000ato the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three\u000agentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never\u000abeen asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this.\u000a"Dead?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly,\u000aeven though she could have checked for herself and could have known\u000ait even without checking.  "That's what I said",  replied the\u000acleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove with\u000athe broom, sending it sideways across the floor.  Mrs. Samsa made a\u000amovement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not\u000acomplete it.  "Now then", said  Mr. Samsa, "let's give thanks to God\u000afor that". He crossed himself, and the three women followed his\u000aexample.  Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said:\u000a"Just look how thin he was.  He didn't eat anything for so long.\u000aThe food came out again just the same as when it went in". Gregor's\u000abody was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it\u000auntil then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did\u000ahe do anything to make them look away.\u000a\u000a"Grete, come with us in here for a little while", said  Mrs. Samsa\u000awith a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom\u000abut not without looking back at the body.  The cleaner shut the door\u000aand opened the window wide.  Although it was still early in the\u000amorning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it.  It\u000awas already the end of March, after all.\u000a\u000aThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in\u000aamazement for their breakfasts;  they had been forgotten about.\u000a"Where is our breakfast?", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner\u000airritably.  She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and\u000asilent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor's\u000aroom.  They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with their\u000ahands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quite\u000alight in the room.\u000a\u000aThen the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr. Samsa appeared in his\u000auniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.  All\u000aof them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her\u000aface against her father's arm.\u000a\u000a"Leave my home.  Now!", said  Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and\u000awithout letting the women from him.  "What do you mean?", asked the\u000amiddle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled\u000asweetly.  The other two held their hands behind their backs and\u000acontinually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud\u000aquarrel which could only end in their favour.  "I mean just what I\u000asaid", answered  Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a\u000astraight line towards the man.  At first, he stood there still,\u000alooking at the ground as if the contents of his head were\u000arearranging themselves into new positions.  "Alright, we'll go\u000athen", he said, and looked up at  Mr. Samsa as if he had been\u000asuddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from\u000aMr. Samsa for his decision.  Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide\u000aand briefly nodded to him several times.  At that, and without\u000adelay, the man actually did take long strides into the front\u000ahallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time\u000abefore and had been listening to what was being said.  Now they\u000ajumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that\u000aMr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the\u000aconnection with their leader.  Once there, all three took their hats\u000afrom the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a\u000aword and left the premises.  Mr. Samsa and the two women followed\u000athem out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust\u000athe men's intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how\u000athe three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many\u000asteps.  As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and\u000awould reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the\u000amore that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher's\u000aboy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his\u000away up and came nearer than they were,  Mr. Samsa and the women came\u000aaway from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.\u000a\u000aThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation\u000aand to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but\u000athey were in serious need of it.  So they sat at the table and wrote\u000athree letters of excusal,  Mr. Samsa to his employers,  Mrs. Samsa\u000ato her contractor and Grete to her principal.  The cleaner came in\u000awhile they were writing to tell them she was going, she'd finished\u000aher work for that morning.  The three of them at first just nodded\u000awithout looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when\u000athe cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up\u000ain irritation.  "Well?", asked  Mr. Samsa.  The charwoman stood in\u000athe doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous\u000agood news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked\u000ato.  The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which\u000ahad been a source of irritation to  Mr. Samsa all the time she had\u000abeen working for them, swayed gently in all directions.  "What is it\u000ayou want then?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most\u000arespect for.  "Yes", she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh\u000athat made her unable to speak straight away, "well then, that thing\u000ain there, you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it.\u000a That's all been sorted out."   Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over\u000atheir letters as if intent on continuing with what they were\u000awriting;  Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing\u000aeverything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite\u000aclear that she was not to.  So, as she was prevented from telling\u000athem all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in\u000aand, clearly peeved, called out "Cheerio then, everyone", turned\u000around sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.\u000a\u000a"Tonight she gets sacked", said  Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply\u000afrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have\u000adestroyed the peace they had only just gained.  They got up and went\u000aover to the window where they remained with their arms around each\u000aother.  Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat\u000athere watching for a while.  Then he called out: "Come here, then.\u000aLet's forget about all that old stuff, shall we.  Come and give me a\u000abit of attention". The two women immediately did as he said,\u000ahurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then\u000athey quickly finished their letters.\u000a\u000aAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which was\u000asomething they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the\u000aopen country outside the town.  They had the tram, filled with warm\u000asunshine, all to themselves.  Leant back comfortably on their seats,\u000athey discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination\u000athey were not at all bad - until then they had never asked each\u000aother about their work but all three had jobs which were very good\u000aand held particularly good promise for the future.  The greatest\u000aimprovement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite\u000aeasily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was\u000asmaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by\u000aGregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more\u000apractical.  All the time, Grete was becoming livelier.  With all the\u000aworry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but,\u000awhile they were talking,  Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost\u000asimultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was\u000ablossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.  They became\u000aquieter.  Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing\u000ait they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for\u000aher.  And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good\u000aintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the\u000afirst to get up and stretch out her young body.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Metamorphosis, by Franz Kafka\u000aTranslated by David Wyllie.\u000a\u000a*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK METAMORPHOSIS ***\u000a\u000a***** This file should be named 5200.txt or 5200.zip *****\u000aThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\u000a        http://www.gutenberg.net/5/2/0/5200/\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\u000awill be renamed.\u000a\u000aCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\u000aone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\u000a(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\u000apermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Donations are accepted in a number of other\u000aways including including checks, online payments and credit card\u000adonations.

For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\u000aGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\u000a\u000aProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\u000aeditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\u000aunless a copyright notice is included.
