The Period\u000a\u000a\u000aIt was the best of times,\u000ait was the worst of times,\u000ait was the age of wisdom,\u000ait was the age of foolishness,\u000ait was the epoch of belief,\u000ait was the epoch of incredulity,\u000ait was the season of Light,\u000ait was the season of Darkness,\u000ait was the spring of hope,\u000ait was the winter of despair,\u000awe had everything before us,\u000awe had nothing before us,\u000awe were all going direct to Heaven,\u000awe were all going direct the other way--\u000ain short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of\u000aits noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for\u000aevil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\u000a\u000aThere were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the\u000athrone of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with\u000aa fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer\u000athan crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,\u000athat things in general were settled for ever.\u000a\u000aIt was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\u000aSpiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,\u000aas at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth\u000ablessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had\u000aheralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were\u000amade for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane\u000aghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its\u000amessages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally\u000adeficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the\u000aearthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,\u000afrom a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange\u000ato relate, have proved more important to the human race than any\u000acommunications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane\u000abrood.\u000a\u000aFrance, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her\u000asister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down\u000ahill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her\u000aChristian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane\u000aachievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue\u000atorn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not\u000akneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks\u000awhich passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty\u000ayards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and\u000aNorway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,\u000aalready marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into\u000aboards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in\u000ait, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses\u000aof some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were\u000asheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with\u000arustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which\u000athe Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of\u000athe Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work\u000aunceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about\u000awith muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion\u000athat they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.\u000a\u000aIn England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to\u000ajustify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and\u000ahighway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;\u000afamilies were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing\u000atheir furniture to upholsterers\u2019 warehouses for security; the highwayman\u000ain the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and\u000achallenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of\u000a\u201cthe Captain,\u201d gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the\u000amail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and\u000athen got shot dead himself by the other four, \u201cin consequence of the\u000afailure of his ammunition:\u201d after which the mail was robbed in peace;\u000athat magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand\u000aand deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the\u000aillustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London\u000agaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law\u000afired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;\u000athieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at\u000aCourt drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles\u2019s, to search\u000afor contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the\u000amusketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences\u000amuch out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy\u000aand ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing\u000aup long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on\u000aSaturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the\u000ahand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of\u000aWestminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,\u000aand to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer\u2019s boy of\u000asixpence.\u000a\u000aAll these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close\u000aupon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\u000aEnvironed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,\u000athose two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the\u000afair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights\u000awith a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred\u000aand seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small\u000acreatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the\u000aroads that lay before them.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aII. The Mail\u000a\u000a\u000aIt was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,\u000abefore the first of the persons with whom this history has business.\u000aThe Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up\u000aShooter\u2019s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,\u000aas the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish\u000afor walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,\u000aand the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the\u000ahorses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the\u000acoach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back\u000ato Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in\u000acombination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose\u000aotherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals\u000aare endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to\u000atheir duty.\u000a\u000aWith drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through\u000athe thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were\u000afalling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested\u000athem and brought them to a stand, with a wary \u201cWo-ho! so-ho-then!\u201d the\u000anear leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an\u000aunusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the\u000ahill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a\u000anervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.\u000a\u000aThere was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its\u000aforlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding\u000anone. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the\u000aair in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the\u000awaves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out\u000aeverything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,\u000aand a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed\u000ainto it, as if they had made it all.\u000a\u000aTwo other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the\u000aside of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the\u000aears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from\u000aanything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was\u000ahidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from\u000athe eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers\u000awere very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on\u000athe road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,\u000awhen every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in\u000a\u201cthe Captain\u2019s\u201d pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable\u000anon-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard\u000aof the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one\u000athousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter\u2019s Hill, as\u000ahe stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,\u000aand keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a\u000aloaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,\u000adeposited on a substratum of cutlass.\u000a\u000aThe Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected\u000athe passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they\u000aall suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but\u000athe horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have\u000ataken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the\u000ajourney.\u000a\u000a\u201cWo-ho!\u201d said the coachman. \u201cSo, then! One more pull and you\u2019re at the\u000atop and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to\u000ait!--Joe!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHalloa!\u201d the guard replied.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat o\u2019clock do you make it, Joe?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTen minutes, good, past eleven.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy blood!\u201d ejaculated the vexed coachman, \u201cand not atop of Shooter\u2019s\u000ayet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,\u000amade a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed\u000asuit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its\u000apassengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach\u000astopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three\u000ahad had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead\u000ainto the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of\u000agetting shot instantly as a highwayman.\u000a\u000aThe last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses\u000astopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for\u000athe descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.\u000a\u000a\u201cTst! Joe!\u201d cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his\u000abox.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you say, Tom?\u201d\u000a\u000aThey both listened.\u000a\u000a\u201cI say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,\u201d returned the guard, leaving his hold\u000aof the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. \u201cGentlemen! In the king\u2019s\u000aname, all of you!\u201d\u000a\u000aWith this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on\u000athe offensive.\u000a\u000aThe passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;\u000athe two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He\u000aremained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained\u000ain the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,\u000aand from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked\u000aback and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up\u000ahis ears and looked back, without contradicting.\u000a\u000aThe stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring\u000aof the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet\u000aindeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to\u000athe coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the\u000apassengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the\u000aquiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding\u000athe breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.\u000a\u000aThe sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo-ho!\u201d the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. \u201cYo there! Stand!\u000aI shall fire!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,\u000aa man\u2019s voice called from the mist, \u201cIs that the Dover mail?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNever you mind what it is!\u201d the guard retorted. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_Is_ that the Dover mail?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI want a passenger, if it is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat passenger?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Jarvis Lorry.\u201d\u000a\u000aOur booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard,\u000athe coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.\u000a\u000a\u201cKeep where you are,\u201d the guard called to the voice in the mist,\u000a\u201cbecause, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in\u000ayour lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering\u000aspeech. \u201cWho wants me? Is it Jerry?\u201d\u000a\u000a(\u201cI don\u2019t like Jerry\u2019s voice, if it is Jerry,\u201d growled the guard to\u000ahimself. \u201cHe\u2019s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.\u201d)\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, Mr. Lorry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know this messenger, guard,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the\u000aroad--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two\u000apassengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and\u000apulled up the window. \u201cHe may come close; there\u2019s nothing wrong.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope there ain\u2019t, but I can\u2019t make so \u2018Nation sure of that,\u201d said the\u000aguard, in gruff soliloquy. \u201cHallo you!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell! And hallo you!\u201d said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.\u000a\u000a\u201cCome on at a footpace! d\u2019ye mind me? And if you\u2019ve got holsters to that\u000asaddle o\u2019 yourn, don\u2019t let me see your hand go nigh \u2018em. For I\u2019m a devil\u000aat a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So\u000anow let\u2019s look at you.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,\u000aand came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider\u000astooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger\u000aa small folded paper. The rider\u2019s horse was blown, and both horse and\u000arider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of\u000athe man.\u000a\u000a\u201cGuard!\u201d said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.\u000a\u000aThe watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised\u000ablunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,\u000aanswered curtly, \u201cSir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson\u2019s Bank. You must\u000aknow Tellson\u2019s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown\u000ato drink. I may read this?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf so be as you\u2019re quick, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and\u000aread--first to himself and then aloud: \u201c\u2018Wait at Dover for Mam\u2019selle.\u2019\u000aIt\u2019s not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED\u000aTO LIFE.\u201d\u000a\u000aJerry started in his saddle. \u201cThat\u2019s a Blazing strange answer, too,\u201d\u000a said he, at his hoarsest.\u000a\u000a\u201cTake that message back, and they will know that I received this, as\u000awell as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at\u000aall assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted\u000atheir watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general\u000apretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape\u000athe hazard of originating any other kind of action.\u000a\u000aThe coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round\u000ait as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss\u000ain his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and\u000ahaving looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,\u000alooked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a\u000afew smith\u2019s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was\u000afurnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown\u000aand stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut\u000ahimself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,\u000aand get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in\u000afive minutes.\u000a\u000a\u201cTom!\u201d softly over the coach roof.\u000a\u000a\u201cHallo, Joe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid you hear the message?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI did, Joe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat did you make of it, Tom?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing at all, Joe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s a coincidence, too,\u201d the guard mused, \u201cfor I made the same of it\u000amyself.\u201d\u000a\u000aJerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not\u000aonly to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and\u000ashake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of\u000aholding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his\u000aheavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within\u000ahearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the\u000ahill.\u000a\u000a\u201cAfter that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won\u2019t trust your\u000afore-legs till I get you on the level,\u201d said this hoarse messenger,\u000aglancing at his mare. \u201c\u2018Recalled to life.\u2019 That\u2019s a Blazing strange\u000amessage. Much of that wouldn\u2019t do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You\u2019d\u000abe in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion,\u000aJerry!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIII. The Night Shadows\u000a\u000a\u000aA wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is\u000aconstituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A\u000asolemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every\u000aone of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every\u000aroom in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating\u000aheart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of\u000aits imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the\u000aawfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I\u000aturn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time\u000ato read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable\u000awater, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses\u000aof buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the\u000abook should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read\u000abut a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an\u000aeternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood\u000ain ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,\u000amy love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable\u000aconsolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that\u000aindividuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life\u2019s end. In\u000aany of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there\u000aa sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their\u000ainnermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?\u000a\u000aAs to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the\u000amessenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the\u000afirst Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the\u000athree passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail\u000acoach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had\u000abeen in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the\u000abreadth of a county between him and the next.\u000a\u000aThe messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at\u000aale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his\u000aown counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that\u000aassorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with\u000ano depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they\u000awere afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too\u000afar apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like\u000aa three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and\u000athroat, which descended nearly to the wearer\u2019s knees. When he stopped\u000afor drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he\u000apoured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he\u000amuffled again.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, Jerry, no!\u201d said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode.\u000a\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn\u2019t\u000asuit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don\u2019t think he\u2019d\u000abeen a drinking!\u201d\u000a\u000aHis message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several\u000atimes, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,\u000awhich was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all\u000aover it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was\u000aso like Smith\u2019s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked\u000awall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might\u000ahave declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.\u000a\u000aWhile he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night\u000awatchman in his box at the door of Tellson\u2019s Bank, by Temple Bar, who\u000awas to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the\u000anight took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such\u000ashapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness.\u000aThey seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.\u000a\u000aWhat time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon\u000aits tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,\u000alikewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms\u000atheir dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.\u000a\u000aTellson\u2019s Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank\u000apassenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what\u000alay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger,\u000aand driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special\u000ajolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little\u000acoach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the\u000abulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great\u000astroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,\u000aand more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson\u2019s, with\u000aall its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then\u000athe strong-rooms underground, at Tellson\u2019s, with such of their valuable\u000astores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a\u000alittle that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among\u000athem with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them\u000asafe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.\u000a\u000aBut, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach\u000a(in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was\u000aalways with him, there was another current of impression that never\u000aceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one\u000aout of a grave.\u000a\u000aNow, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him\u000awas the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did\u000anot indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by\u000ayears, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,\u000aand in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt,\u000adefiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;\u000aso did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands\u000aand figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was\u000aprematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this\u000aspectre:\u000a\u000a\u201cBuried how long?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe answer was always the same: \u201cAlmost eighteen years.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou had abandoned all hope of being dug out?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLong ago.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know that you are recalled to life?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey tell me so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope you care to live?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes\u000athe broken reply was, \u201cWait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon.\u201d\u000a Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,\u000a\u201cTake me to her.\u201d Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it\u000awas, \u201cI don\u2019t know her. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,\u000aand dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his\u000ahands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth\u000ahanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The\u000apassenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the\u000areality of mist and rain on his cheek.\u000a\u000aYet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving\u000apatch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating\u000aby jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train\u000aof the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the\u000areal business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express\u000asent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out\u000aof the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost\u000ait again.\u000a\u000a\u201cBuried how long?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAlmost eighteen years.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope you care to live?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d\u000a\u000aDig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two\u000apassengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm\u000asecurely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two\u000aslumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again\u000aslid away into the bank and the grave.\u000a\u000a\u201cBuried how long?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAlmost eighteen years.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou had abandoned all hope of being dug out?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLong ago.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in\u000ahis hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary\u000apassenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the\u000ashadows of the night were gone.\u000a\u000aHe lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a\u000aridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left\u000alast night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,\u000ain which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained\u000aupon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,\u000aand the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.\u000a\u000a\u201cEighteen years!\u201d said the passenger, looking at the sun. \u201cGracious\u000aCreator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIV. The Preparation\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,\u000athe head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his\u000acustom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey\u000afrom London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous\u000atraveller upon.\u000a\u000aBy that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be\u000acongratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective\u000aroadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp\u000aand dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather\u000alike a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out\u000aof it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and\u000amuddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The\u000atide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,\u000asir?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.\u000aShow Concord! Gentleman\u2019s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off\u000agentleman\u2019s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.)\u000aFetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the\u000amail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from\u000ahead to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the\u000aRoyal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,\u000aall kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another\u000adrawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all\u000aloitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord\u000aand the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a\u000abrown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large\u000asquare cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to\u000ahis breakfast.\u000a\u000aThe coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman\u000ain brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,\u000awith its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,\u000athat he might have been sitting for his portrait.\u000a\u000aVery orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a\u000aloud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,\u000aas though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and\u000aevanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain\u000aof it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a\u000afine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He\u000awore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his\u000ahead: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which\u000alooked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.\u000aHis linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,\u000awas as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring\u000abeach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A\u000aface habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the\u000aquaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost\u000atheir owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and\u000areserved expression of Tellson\u2019s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his\u000acheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.\u000aBut, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson\u2019s Bank were\u000aprincipally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps\u000asecond-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.\u000a\u000aCompleting his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,\u000aMr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him,\u000aand he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:\u000a\u000a\u201cI wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any\u000atime to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a\u000agentleman from Tellson\u2019s Bank. Please to let me know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, sir. Tellson\u2019s Bank in London, sir?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in\u000atheir travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A\u000avast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company\u2019s House.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,\u000asir?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last\u000afrom France.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people\u2019s\u000atime here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and\u000aCompany was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen\u000ayears ago?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from\u000athe truth.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, sir!\u201d\u000a\u000aRounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the\u000atable, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,\u000adropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while\u000ahe ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the\u000aimmemorial usage of waiters in all ages.\u000a\u000aWhen Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on\u000athe beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away\u000afrom the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine\u000aostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling\u000awildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was\u000adestruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and\u000abrought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong\u000aa piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be\u000adipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little\u000afishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by\u000anight, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide\u000amade, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,\u000asometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable\u000athat nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.\u000a\u000aAs the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been\u000aat intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became\u000aagain charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry\u2019s thoughts seemed to cloud\u000atoo. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting\u000ahis dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,\u000adigging, digging, in the live red coals.\u000a\u000aA bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no\u000aharm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.\u000aMr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last\u000aglassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is\u000aever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has\u000agot to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow\u000astreet, and rumbled into the inn-yard.\u000a\u000aHe set down his glass untouched. \u201cThis is Mam\u2019selle!\u201d said he.\u000a\u000aIn a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette\u000ahad arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from\u000aTellson\u2019s.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo soon?\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none\u000athen, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson\u2019s\u000aimmediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.\u000a\u000aThe gentleman from Tellson\u2019s had nothing left for it but to empty his\u000aglass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen\u000awig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette\u2019s apartment.\u000aIt was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black\u000ahorsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and\u000aoiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room\u000awere gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep\u000agraves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected\u000afrom them until they were dug out.\u000a\u000aThe obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his\u000away over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for\u000athe moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall\u000acandles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and\u000athe fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,\u000aand still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As\u000ahis eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden\u000ahair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and\u000aa forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth\u000ait was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was\u000anot quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright\u000afixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his\u000aeyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,\u000aof a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very\u000aChannel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran\u000ahigh. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of\u000athe gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital\u000aprocession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were\u000aoffering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the\u000afeminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.\u000a\u000a\u201cPray take a seat, sir.\u201d In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a\u000alittle foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI kiss your hand, miss,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier\u000adate, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.\u000a\u000a\u201cI received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that\u000asome intelligence--or discovery--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe word is not material, miss; either word will do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so\u000along dead--\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the\u000ahospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for\u000aanybody in their absurd baskets!\u000a\u000a\u201c--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate\u000awith a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for\u000athe purpose.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMyself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs I was prepared to hear, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a\u000apretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he\u000awas than she. He made her another bow.\u000a\u000a\u201cI replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by\u000athose who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to\u000aFrance, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with\u000ame, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,\u000aduring the journey, under that worthy gentleman\u2019s protection. The\u000agentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to\u000abeg the favour of his waiting for me here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was happy,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cto be entrusted with the charge. I shall\u000abe more happy to execute it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me\u000aby the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the\u000abusiness, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising\u000anature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a\u000astrong and eager interest to know what they are.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNaturally,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cYes--I--\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the\u000aears, \u201cIt is very difficult to begin.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young\u000aforehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty\u000aand characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,\u000aas if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing\u000ashadow.\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you quite a stranger to me, sir?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAm I not?\u201d Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with\u000aan argumentative smile.\u000a\u000aBetween the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of\u000awhich was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression\u000adeepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which\u000ashe had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the\u000amoment she raised her eyes again, went on:\u000a\u000a\u201cIn your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you\u000aas a young English lady, Miss Manette?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you please, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to\u000aacquit myself of. In your reception of it, don\u2019t heed me any more than\u000aif I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with\u000ayour leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cStory!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,\u000ain a hurry, \u201cYes, customers; in the banking business we usually call\u000aour connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific\u000agentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot of Beauvais?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the\u000agentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the\u000agentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there.\u000aOur relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that\u000atime in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and\u000aI was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other\u000aFrench gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson\u2019s hands.\u000aIn a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for\u000ascores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;\u000athere is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like\u000asentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my\u000abusiness life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in\u000athe course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere\u000amachine. To go on--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut this is my father\u2019s story, sir; and I begin to think\u201d--the\u000acuriously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--\u201cthat when I was\u000aleft an orphan through my mother\u2019s surviving my father only two years,\u000ait was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced\u000ato take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then\u000aconducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding\u000athe chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub\u000ahis chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking\u000adown into her face while she sat looking up into his.\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself\u000ajust now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold\u000awith my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect\u000athat I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of\u000aTellson\u2019s House since, and I have been busy with the other business of\u000aTellson\u2019s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance\u000aof them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary\u000aMangle.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry\u000aflattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most\u000aunnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was\u000abefore), and resumed his former attitude.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your\u000aregretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died\u000awhen he did--Don\u2019t be frightened! How you start!\u201d\u000a\u000aShe did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.\u000a\u000a\u201cPray,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from\u000athe back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped\u000ahim in so violent a tremble: \u201cpray control your agitation--a matter of\u000abusiness. As I was saying--\u201d\u000a\u000aHer look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:\u000a\u000a\u201cAs I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly\u000aand silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not\u000abeen difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could\u000atrace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a\u000aprivilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid\u000ato speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the\u000aprivilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one\u000ato the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had\u000aimplored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of\u000ahim, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have\u000abeen the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI entreat you to tell me more, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will. I am going to. You can bear it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this\u000amoment.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected. That\u2019s good!\u201d (Though\u000ahis manner was less satisfied than his words.) \u201cA matter of business.\u000aRegard it as a matter of business--business that must be done. Now\u000aif this doctor\u2019s wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit,\u000ahad suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was\u000aborn--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe little child was a daughter, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA daughter. A-a-matter of business--don\u2019t be distressed. Miss, if the\u000apoor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,\u000athat she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the\u000ainheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by\u000arearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don\u2019t kneel! In\u000aHeaven\u2019s name why should you kneel to me!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA--a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact\u000abusiness if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly\u000amention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many\u000ashillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so\u000amuch more at my ease about your state of mind.\u201d\u000a\u000aWithout directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had\u000avery gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp\u000ahis wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she\u000acommunicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Courage! Business! You have business before\u000ayou; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with\u000ayou. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened\u000aher unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old,\u000ato grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud\u000aupon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his\u000aheart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the\u000aflowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have\u000abeen already tinged with grey.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know that your parents had no great possession, and that what\u000athey had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new\u000adiscovery, of money, or of any other property; but--\u201d\u000a\u000aHe felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the\u000aforehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was\u000anow immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut he has been--been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too\u000aprobable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.\u000aStill, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant\u000ain Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to\u000arestore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.\u201d\u000a\u000aA shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a\u000alow, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,\u000a\u000a\u201cI am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost--not him!\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. \u201cThere, there,\u000athere! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now.\u000aYou are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair\u000asea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, \u201cI have been free, I\u000ahave been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly one thing more,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a\u000awholesome means of enforcing her attention: \u201che has been found under\u000aanother name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be\u000aworse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to\u000aknow whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly\u000aheld prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,\u000abecause it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject,\u000aanywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all\u000aevents--out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even\u000aTellson\u2019s, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of\u000athe matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring\u000ato it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries,\u000aand memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, \u2018Recalled to Life;\u2019\u000awhich may mean anything. But what is the matter! She doesn\u2019t notice a\u000aword! Miss Manette!\u201d\u000a\u000aPerfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she\u000asat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed\u000aupon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or\u000abranded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he\u000afeared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called\u000aout loudly for assistance without moving.\u000a\u000aA wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to\u000abe all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some\u000aextraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most\u000awonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too,\u000aor a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the\u000ainn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the\u000apoor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him\u000aflying back against the nearest wall.\u000a\u000a(\u201cI really think this must be a man!\u201d was Mr. Lorry\u2019s breathless\u000areflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, look at you all!\u201d bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.\u000a\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring\u000aat me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don\u2019t you go and fetch\u000athings? I\u2019ll let you know, if you don\u2019t bring smelling-salts, cold\u000awater, and vinegar, quick, I will.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she\u000asoftly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and\u000agentleness: calling her \u201cmy precious!\u201d and \u201cmy bird!\u201d and spreading her\u000agolden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd you in brown!\u201d she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;\u000a\u201ccouldn\u2019t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her\u000ato death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do\u000ayou call _that_ being a Banker?\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to\u000aanswer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler\u000asympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn\u000aservants under the mysterious penalty of \u201cletting them know\u201d something\u000anot mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a\u000aregular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head\u000aupon her shoulder.\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope she will do well now,\u201d said Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and\u000ahumility, \u201cthat you accompany Miss Manette to France?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA likely thing, too!\u201d replied the strong woman. \u201cIf it was ever\u000aintended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence\u000awould have cast my lot in an island?\u201d\u000a\u000aThis being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to\u000aconsider it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aV. The Wine-shop\u000a\u000a\u000aA large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The\u000aaccident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled\u000aout with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just\u000aoutside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.\u000a\u000aAll the people within reach had suspended their business, or their\u000aidleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular\u000astones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have\u000athought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,\u000ahad dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own\u000ajostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,\u000amade scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help\u000awomen, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all\u000arun out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in\u000athe puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with\u000ahandkerchiefs from women\u2019s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants\u2019\u000amouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;\u000aothers, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and\u000athere, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new\u000adirections; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed\u000apieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted\u000afragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the\u000awine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up\u000aalong with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,\u000aif anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous\u000apresence.\u000a\u000aA shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,\u000aand children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There\u000awas little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a\u000aspecial companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part\u000aof every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the\u000aluckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,\u000ashaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen\u000atogether. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been\u000amost abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these\u000ademonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who\u000ahad left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in\u000amotion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of\u000ahot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own\u000astarved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men\u000awith bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into\u000athe winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom\u000agathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.\u000a\u000aThe wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street\u000ain the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had\u000astained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many\u000awooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks\u000aon the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was\u000astained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.\u000aThose who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a\u000atigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his\u000ahead more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled\u000aupon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.\u000a\u000aThe time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the\u000astreet-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.\u000a\u000aAnd now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary\u000agleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was\u000aheavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in\u000awaiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;\u000abut, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a\u000aterrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the\u000afabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,\u000apassed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered\u000ain every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which\u000ahad worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the\u000achildren had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the\u000agrown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,\u000awas the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out\u000aof the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and\u000alines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and\u000apaper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of\u000afirewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless\u000achimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,\u000aamong its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the\u000abaker\u2019s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of\u000abad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that\u000awas offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting\u000achestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every\u000afarthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant\u000adrops of oil.\u000a\u000aIts abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding\u000astreet, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets\u000adiverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags\u000aand nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them\u000athat looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some\u000awild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and\u000aslinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor\u000acompressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted\u000ainto the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or\u000ainflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)\u000awere, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman\u000apainted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of\u000ameagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,\u000acroaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were\u000agloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a\u000aflourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler\u2019s knives\u000aand axes were sharp and bright, the smith\u2019s hammers were heavy, and the\u000agunmaker\u2019s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,\u000awith their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but\u000abroke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down\u000athe middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy\u000arains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across\u000athe streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and\u000apulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,\u000aand hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly\u000amanner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and\u000athe ship and crew were in peril of tempest.\u000a\u000aFor, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region\u000ashould have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so\u000along, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling\u000aup men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their\u000acondition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over\u000aFrance shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of\u000asong and feather, took no warning.\u000a\u000aThe wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its\u000aappearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside\u000ait, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle\u000afor the lost wine. \u201cIt\u2019s not my affair,\u201d said he, with a final shrug\u000aof the shoulders. \u201cThe people from the market did it. Let them bring\u000aanother.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,\u000ahe called to him across the way:\u000a\u000a\u201cSay, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often\u000athe way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is\u000aoften the way with his tribe too.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?\u201d said the wine-shop\u000akeeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of\u000amud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. \u201cWhy do you write\u000ain the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place\u000ato write such words in?\u201d\u000a\u000aIn his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,\u000aperhaps not) upon the joker\u2019s heart. The joker rapped it with his\u000aown, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing\u000aattitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his\u000ahand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly\u000apractical character, he looked, under those circumstances.\u000a\u000a\u201cPut it on, put it on,\u201d said the other. \u201cCall wine, wine; and finish\u000athere.\u201d With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker\u2019s\u000adress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on\u000ahis account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.\u000a\u000aThis wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,\u000aand he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a\u000abitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.\u000aHis shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to\u000athe elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own\u000acrisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good\u000aeyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on\u000athe whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong\u000aresolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing\u000adown a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn\u000athe man.\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he\u000acame in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with\u000aa watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand\u000aheavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of\u000amanner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might\u000ahave predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself\u000ain any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being\u000asensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright\u000ashawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large\u000aearrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick\u000aher teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported\u000aby her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but\u000acoughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting\u000aof her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a\u000aline, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the\u000ashop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while\u000ahe stepped over the way.\u000a\u000aThe wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they\u000arested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in\u000aa corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing\u000adominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply\u000aof wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the\u000aelderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, \u201cThis is our man.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?\u201d said Monsieur Defarge\u000ato himself; \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse\u000awith the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow goes it, Jacques?\u201d said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. \u201cIs\u000aall the spilt wine swallowed?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEvery drop, Jacques,\u201d answered Monsieur Defarge.\u000a\u000aWhen this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,\u000apicking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,\u000aand raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is not often,\u201d said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur\u000aDefarge, \u201cthat many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or\u000aof anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is so, Jacques,\u201d Monsieur Defarge returned.\u000a\u000aAt this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still\u000ausing her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of\u000acough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\u000a\u000aThe last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty\u000adrinking vessel and smacked his lips.\u000a\u000a\u201cAh! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle\u000aalways have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I\u000aright, Jacques?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are right, Jacques,\u201d was the response of Monsieur Defarge.\u000a\u000aThis third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment\u000awhen Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and\u000aslightly rustled in her seat.\u000a\u000a\u201cHold then! True!\u201d muttered her husband. \u201cGentlemen--my wife!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three\u000aflourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and\u000agiving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the\u000awine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose\u000aof spirit, and became absorbed in it.\u000a\u000a\u201cGentlemen,\u201d said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly\u000aupon her, \u201cgood day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you\u000awished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the\u000afifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard\u000aclose to the left here,\u201d pointing with his hand, \u201cnear to the window of\u000amy establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been\u000athere, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!\u201d\u000a\u000aThey paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur\u000aDefarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly\u000agentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.\u000a\u000a\u201cWillingly, sir,\u201d said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to\u000athe door.\u000a\u000aTheir conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first\u000aword, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had\u000anot lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then\u000abeckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge\u000aknitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.\u000a\u000aMr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,\u000ajoined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own\u000acompany just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,\u000aand was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited\u000aby a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the\u000agloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee\u000ato the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was\u000aa gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable\u000atransformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour\u000ain his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,\u000aangry, dangerous man.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.\u201d\u000a Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began\u000aascending the stairs.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs he alone?\u201d the latter whispered.\u000a\u000a\u201cAlone! God help him, who should be with him!\u201d said the other, in the\u000asame low voice.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs he always alone, then?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOf his own desire?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOf his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they\u000afound me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be\u000adiscreet--as he was then, so he is now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is greatly changed?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cChanged!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,\u000aand mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so\u000aforcible. Mr. Lorry\u2019s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his\u000atwo companions ascended higher and higher.\u000a\u000aSuch a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded\u000aparts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile\u000aindeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation\u000awithin the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,\u000athe room or rooms within every door that opened on the general\u000astaircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides\u000aflinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and\u000ahopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted\u000athe air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their\u000aintangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost\u000ainsupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt\u000aand poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to\u000ahis young companion\u2019s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.\u000aJarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made\u000aat a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left\u000auncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed\u000ato crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were\u000acaught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer\u000aor lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any\u000apromise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.\u000a\u000aAt last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the\u000athird time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination\u000aand of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story\u000awas reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in\u000aadvance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he\u000adreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about\u000ahere, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over\u000ahis shoulder, took out a key.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe door is locked then, my friend?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, surprised.\u000a\u000a\u201cAy. Yes,\u201d was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it necessary to turn the key.\u201d Monsieur Defarge whispered it\u000acloser in his ear, and frowned heavily.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be\u000afrightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what\u000aharm--if his door was left open.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it possible!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it possible!\u201d repeated Defarge, bitterly. \u201cYes. And a beautiful\u000aworld we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things\u000aare possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under\u000athat sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word\u000aof it had reached the young lady\u2019s ears. But, by this time she trembled\u000aunder such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,\u000aand, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent\u000aon him to speak a word or two of reassurance.\u000a\u000a\u201cCourage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a\u000amoment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,\u000aall the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you\u000abring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.\u000aThat\u2019s well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!\u201d\u000a\u000aThey went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were\u000asoon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at\u000aonce in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at\u000athe side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which\u000athe door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing\u000afootsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed\u000athemselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the\u000awine-shop.\u000a\u000a\u201cI forgot them in the surprise of your visit,\u201d explained Monsieur\u000aDefarge. \u201cLeave us, good boys; we have business here.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe three glided by, and went silently down.\u000a\u000aThere appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of\u000athe wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.\u000aLorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you make a show of Monsieur Manette?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs that well?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_I_ think it is well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho are the few? How do you choose them?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the\u000asight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another\u000athing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in\u000athrough the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck\u000atwice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to\u000amake a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,\u000athree or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned\u000ait as heavily as he could.\u000a\u000aThe door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the\u000aroom and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more\u000athan a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.\u000a\u000aHe looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry\u000agot his arm securely round the daughter\u2019s waist, and held her; for he\u000afelt that she was sinking.\u000a\u000a\u201cA-a-a-business, business!\u201d he urged, with a moisture that was not of\u000abusiness shining on his cheek. \u201cCome in, come in!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am afraid of it,\u201d she answered, shuddering.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf it? What?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI mean of him. Of my father.\u201d\u000a\u000aRendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of\u000atheir conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his\u000ashoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her\u000adown just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.\u000a\u000aDefarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,\u000atook out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,\u000amethodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he\u000acould make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to\u000awhere the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.\u000a\u000aThe garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim\u000aand dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the\u000aroof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from\u000athe street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any\u000aother door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this\u000adoor was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.\u000aSuch a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it\u000awas difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit\u000aalone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work\u000arequiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being\u000adone in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face\u000atowards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at\u000ahim, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very\u000abusy, making shoes.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVI. The Shoemaker\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cGood day!\u201d said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that\u000abent low over the shoemaking.\u000a\u000aIt was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the\u000asalutation, as if it were at a distance:\u000a\u000a\u201cGood day!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are still hard at work, I see?\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the\u000avoice replied, \u201cYes--I am working.\u201d This time, a pair of haggard eyes\u000ahad looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.\u000a\u000aThe faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the\u000afaintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no\u000adoubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was\u000athe faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo\u000aof a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and\u000aresonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once\u000abeautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and\u000asuppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive\u000ait was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,\u000awearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered\u000ahome and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.\u000a\u000aSome minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked\u000aup again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical\u000aperception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were\u000aaware of had stood, was not yet empty.\u000a\u000a\u201cI want,\u201d said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,\u000a\u201cto let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,\u000aat the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the\u000aother side of him; then, upward at the speaker.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can bear a little more light?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI must bear it, if you let it in.\u201d (Laying the palest shadow of a\u000astress upon the second word.)\u000a\u000aThe opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that\u000aangle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and\u000ashowed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his\u000alabour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his\u000afeet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very\u000along, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and\u000athinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet\u000adark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really\u000aotherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.\u000aHis yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body\u000ato be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose\u000astockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion\u000afrom direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of\u000aparchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.\u000a\u000aHe had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones\u000aof it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,\u000apausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without\u000afirst looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had\u000alost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without\u000afirst wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?\u201d asked Defarge,\u000amotioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When\u000ahe had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker\u000alooked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the\u000aunsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at\u000ait (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then\u000athe hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The\u000alook and the action had occupied but an instant.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have a visitor, you see,\u201d said Monsieur Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHere is a visitor.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his\u000awork.\u000a\u000a\u201cCome!\u201d said Defarge. \u201cHere is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when\u000ahe sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry took it in his hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cTell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker\u2019s name.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:\u000a\u000a\u201cI forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI said, couldn\u2019t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur\u2019s\u000ainformation?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a lady\u2019s shoe. It is a young lady\u2019s walking-shoe. It is in the\u000apresent mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.\u201d He\u000aglanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd the maker\u2019s name?\u201d said Defarge.\u000a\u000aNow that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand\u000ain the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the\u000ahollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and\u000aso on in regular changes, without a moment\u2019s intermission. The task of\u000arecalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he\u000ahad spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or\u000aendeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a\u000afast-dying man.\u000a\u000a\u201cDid you ask me for my name?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAssuredly I did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne Hundred and Five, North Tower.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne Hundred and Five, North Tower.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work\u000aagain, until the silence was again broken.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are not a shoemaker by trade?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly\u000aat him.\u000a\u000aHis haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the\u000aquestion to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back\u000aon the questioner when they had sought the ground.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I\u000alearnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to--\u201d\u000a\u000aHe lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his\u000ahands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face\u000afrom which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and\u000aresumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a\u000asubject of last night.\u000a\u000a\u201cI asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after\u000aa long while, and I have made shoes ever since.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr.\u000aLorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:\u000a\u000a\u201cMonsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the\u000aquestioner.\u000a\u000a\u201cMonsieur Manette\u201d; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge\u2019s arm; \u201cdo you\u000aremember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old\u000abanker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your\u000amind, Monsieur Manette?\u201d\u000a\u000aAs the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.\u000aLorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent\u000aintelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves\u000athrough the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded\u000aagain, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And\u000aso exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who\u000ahad crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where\u000ashe now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only\u000araised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and\u000ashut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,\u000atrembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young\u000abreast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression\u000arepeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it\u000alooked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.\u000a\u000aDarkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and\u000aless attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground\u000aand looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he\u000atook the shoe up, and resumed his work.\u000a\u000a\u201cHave you recognised him, monsieur?\u201d asked Defarge in a whisper.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have\u000aunquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so\u000awell. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!\u201d\u000a\u000aShe had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on\u000awhich he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the\u000afigure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped\u000aover his labour.\u000a\u000aNot a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit,\u000abeside him, and he bent over his work.\u000a\u000aIt happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument\u000ain his hand, for his shoemaker\u2019s knife. It lay on that side of him\u000awhich was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was\u000astooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He\u000araised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward,\u000abut she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his\u000astriking at her with the knife, though they had.\u000a\u000aHe stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began\u000ato form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in\u000athe pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u000a\u000aWith the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her\u000alips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she\u000alaid his ruined head there.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are not the gaoler\u2019s daughter?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe sighed \u201cNo.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u000a\u000aNot yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench\u000abeside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange\u000athrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he\u000alaid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.\u000a\u000aHer golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed\u000aaside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and\u000alittle, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action\u000ahe went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his\u000ashoemaking.\u000a\u000aBut not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his\u000ashoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to\u000abe sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand\u000ato his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag\u000aattached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained\u000aa very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden\u000ahairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.\u000a\u000aHe took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. \u201cIt is\u000athe same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!\u201d\u000a\u000aAs the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to\u000abecome conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the\u000alight, and looked at her.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned\u000aout--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was\u000abrought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. \u2018You will\u000aleave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they\u000amay in the spirit.\u2019 Those were the words I said. I remember them very\u000awell.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.\u000aBut when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently,\u000athough slowly.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow was this?--_Was it you_?\u201d\u000a\u000aOnce more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a\u000afrightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only\u000asaid, in a low voice, \u201cI entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near\u000aus, do not speak, do not move!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHark!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhose voice was that?\u201d\u000a\u000aHis hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white\u000ahair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his\u000ashoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and\u000atried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and\u000agloomily shook his head.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can\u2019t be. See what the\u000aprisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face\u000ashe knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He\u000awas--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your\u000aname, my gentle angel?\u201d\u000a\u000aHailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees\u000abefore him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.\u000a\u000a\u201cO, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,\u000aand who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I\u000acannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may\u000atell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless\u000ame. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!\u201d\u000a\u000aHis cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and\u000alighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you hear in my voice--I don\u2019t know that it is so, but I hope it\u000ais--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was\u000asweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in\u000atouching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your\u000abreast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when\u000aI hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you\u000awith all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the\u000aremembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away,\u000aweep for it, weep for it!\u201d\u000a\u000aShe held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a\u000achild.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I\u000ahave come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at\u000apeace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,\u000aand of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And\u000aif, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,\u000aand of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my\u000ahonoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake\u000astriven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of\u000amy poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep\u000afor her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred\u000atears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank\u000aGod for us, thank God!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so\u000atouching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which\u000ahad gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.\u000a\u000aWhen the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving\u000abreast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all\u000astorms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm\u000acalled Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and\u000adaughter from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay\u000athere in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his\u000ahead might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained\u000ahim from the light.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf, without disturbing him,\u201d she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as\u000ahe stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, \u201call could be\u000aarranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he\u000acould be taken away--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, consider. Is he fit for the journey?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cMore fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to\u000ahim.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is true,\u201d said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. \u201cMore\u000athan that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.\u000aSay, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s business,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his\u000amethodical manners; \u201cand if business is to be done, I had better do it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen be so kind,\u201d urged Miss Manette, \u201cas to leave us here. You see how\u000acomposed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me\u000anow. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from\u000ainterruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back,\u000aas quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until\u000ayou return, and then we will remove him straight.\u201d\u000a\u000aBoth Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and\u000ain favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage\u000aand horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed,\u000afor the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily\u000adividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away\u000ato do it.\u000a\u000aThen, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the\u000ahard ground close at the father\u2019s side, and watched him. The darkness\u000adeepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed\u000athrough the chinks in the wall.\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and\u000ahad brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and\u000ameat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the\u000alamp he carried, on the shoemaker\u2019s bench (there was nothing else in the\u000agarret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and\u000aassisted him to his feet.\u000a\u000aNo human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in\u000athe scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened,\u000awhether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that\u000ahe was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They\u000atried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to\u000aanswer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for\u000athe time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of\u000aoccasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen\u000ain him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his\u000adaughter\u2019s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.\u000a\u000aIn the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he\u000aate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak\u000aand other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to\u000ahis daughter\u2019s drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand\u000ain both his own.\u000a\u000aThey began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.\u000aLorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps\u000aof the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and\u000around at the walls.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if\u000ashe had repeated it.\u000a\u000a\u201cRemember? No, I don\u2019t remember. It was so very long ago.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his\u000aprison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter,\u000a\u201cOne Hundred and Five, North Tower;\u201d and when he looked about him, it\u000aevidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed\u000ahim. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his\u000atread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was\u000ano drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he\u000adropped his daughter\u2019s hand and clasped his head again.\u000a\u000aNo crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the\u000amany windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An unnatural\u000asilence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and\u000athat was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and\u000asaw nothing.\u000a\u000aThe prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed\u000ahim, when Mr. Lorry\u2019s feet were arrested on the step by his asking,\u000amiserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame\u000aDefarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and\u000awent, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly\u000abrought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned\u000aagainst the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.\u000a\u000aDefarge got upon the box, and gave the word \u201cTo the Barrier!\u201d The\u000apostilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble\u000aover-swinging lamps.\u000a\u000aUnder the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better\u000astreets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds,\u000ailluminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city\u000agates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. \u201cYour papers,\u000atravellers!\u201d \u201cSee here then, Monsieur the Officer,\u201d said Defarge,\u000agetting down, and taking him gravely apart, \u201cthese are the papers of\u000amonsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with\u000ahim, at the--\u201d He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the\u000amilitary lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm\u000ain uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day\u000aor an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. \u201cIt is well.\u000aForward!\u201d from the uniform. \u201cAdieu!\u201d from Defarge. And so, under a short\u000agrove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great\u000agrove of stars.\u000a\u000aBeneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from\u000athis little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their\u000arays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything\u000ais suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.\u000aAll through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more\u000awhispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried\u000aman who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever\u000alost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope you care to be recalled to life?\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd the old answer:\u000a\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000aThe end of the first book.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBook the Second--the Golden Thread\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI. Five Years Later\u000a\u000a\u000aTellson\u2019s Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the\u000ayear one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very\u000adark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,\u000amoreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were\u000aproud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,\u000aproud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence\u000ain those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if\u000ait were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was\u000ano passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more\u000aconvenient places of business. Tellson\u2019s (they said) wanted\u000ano elbow-room, Tellson\u2019s wanted no light, Tellson\u2019s wanted no\u000aembellishment. Noakes and Co.\u2019s might, or Snooks Brothers\u2019 might; but\u000aTellson\u2019s, thank Heaven--!\u000a\u000aAny one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the\u000aquestion of rebuilding Tellson\u2019s. In this respect the House was much\u000aon a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for\u000asuggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly\u000aobjectionable, but were only the more respectable.\u000a\u000aThus it had come to pass, that Tellson\u2019s was the triumphant perfection\u000aof inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with\u000aa weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson\u2019s down two steps,\u000aand came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little\u000acounters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the\u000awind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of\u000awindows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,\u000aand which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the\u000aheavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing\u000a\u201cthe House,\u201d you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,\u000awhere you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its\u000ahands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal\u000atwilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden\u000adrawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when\u000athey were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they\u000awere fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among\u000athe neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good\u000apolish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms\u000amade of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their\u000aparchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family\u000apapers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great\u000adining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year\u000aone thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you\u000aby your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released\u000afrom the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads\u000aexposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of\u000aAbyssinia or Ashantee.\u000a\u000aBut indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue\u000awith all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson\u2019s.\u000aDeath is Nature\u2019s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation\u2019s?\u000aAccordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note\u000awas put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the\u000apurloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder\u000aof a horse at Tellson\u2019s door, who made off with it, was put to\u000aDeath; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of\u000athree-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to\u000aDeath. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it\u000amight almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the\u000areverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each\u000aparticular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked\u000aafter. Thus, Tellson\u2019s, in its day, like greater places of business,\u000aits contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid\u000alow before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately\u000adisposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the\u000aground floor had, in a rather significant manner.\u000a\u000aCramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson\u2019s, the\u000aoldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young\u000aman into Tellson\u2019s London house, they hid him somewhere till he was\u000aold. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full\u000aTellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to\u000abe seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches\u000aand gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.\u000a\u000aOutside Tellson\u2019s--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an\u000aodd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live\u000asign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless\u000aupon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin\u000aof twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson\u2019s,\u000ain a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always\u000atolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted\u000athis person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful\u000aoccasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the\u000aeasterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added\u000aappellation of Jerry.\u000a\u000aThe scene was Mr. Cruncher\u2019s private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley,\u000aWhitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March\u000amorning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself\u000aalways spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under\u000athe impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a\u000apopular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher\u2019s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were\u000abut two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it\u000amight be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as\u000ait was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was\u000aalready scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged\u000afor breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth\u000awas spread.\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin\u000aat home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll\u000aand surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair\u000alooking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he\u000aexclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:\u000a\u000a\u201cBust me, if she ain\u2019t at it agin!\u201d\u000a\u000aA woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a\u000acorner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the\u000aperson referred to.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. \u201cYou\u2019re at it\u000aagin, are you?\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at\u000athe woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the\u000aodd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher\u2019s domestic economy, that,\u000awhereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he\u000aoften got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his\u000amark--\u201cwhat are you up to, Aggerawayter?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was only saying my prayers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSaying your prayers! You\u2019re a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping\u000ayourself down and praying agin me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was not praying against you; I was praying for you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou weren\u2019t. And if you were, I won\u2019t be took the liberty with. Here!\u000ayour mother\u2019s a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your\u000afather\u2019s prosperity. You\u2019ve got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.\u000aYou\u2019ve got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping\u000aherself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out\u000aof the mouth of her only child.\u201d\u000a\u000aMaster Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning\u000ato his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal\u000aboard.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd what do you suppose, you conceited female,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, with\u000aunconscious inconsistency, \u201cthat the worth of _your_ prayers may be?\u000aName the price that you put _your_ prayers at!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than\u000athat.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWorth no more than that,\u201d repeated Mr. Cruncher. \u201cThey ain\u2019t worth\u000amuch, then. Whether or no, I won\u2019t be prayed agin, I tell you. I can\u2019t\u000aafford it. I\u2019m not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking. If\u000ayou must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and\u000achild, and not in opposition to \u2018em. If I had had any but a unnat\u2019ral\u000awife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat\u2019ral mother, I might\u000ahave made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and\u000acountermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck.\u000aB-u-u-ust me!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting\u000aon his clothes, \u201cif I ain\u2019t, what with piety and one blowed thing and\u000aanother, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor\u000adevil of a honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my\u000aboy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and\u000athen, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I\u000atell you,\u201d here he addressed his wife once more, \u201cI won\u2019t be gone agin,\u000ain this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I\u2019m as sleepy as\u000alaudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn\u2019t know, if\u000ait wasn\u2019t for the pain in \u2018em, which was me and which somebody else, yet\u000aI\u2019m none the better for it in pocket; and it\u2019s my suspicion that you\u2019ve\u000abeen at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for\u000ait in pocket, and I won\u2019t put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you\u000asay now!\u201d\u000a\u000aGrowling, in addition, such phrases as \u201cAh! yes! You\u2019re religious, too.\u000aYou wouldn\u2019t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband\u000aand child, would you? Not you!\u201d and throwing off other sarcastic sparks\u000afrom the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook\u000ahimself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business.\u000aIn the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes,\u000aand whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father\u2019s did,\u000akept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor\u000awoman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made\u000ahis toilet, with a suppressed cry of \u201cYou are going to flop, mother.\u000a--Halloa, father!\u201d and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in\u000aagain with an undutiful grin.\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher\u2019s temper was not at all improved when he came to his\u000abreakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher\u2019s saying grace with particular\u000aanimosity.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?\u201d\u000a\u000aHis wife explained that she had merely \u201casked a blessing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected\u000ato see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife\u2019s petitions. \u201cI\u000aain\u2019t a going to be blest out of house and home. I won\u2019t have my wittles\u000ablest off my table. Keep still!\u201d\u000a\u000aExceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party\u000awhich had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried\u000ahis breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed\u000ainmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o\u2019clock he smoothed his ruffled\u000aaspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as\u000ahe could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation\u000aof the day.\u000a\u000aIt could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite\u000adescription of himself as \u201ca honest tradesman.\u201d His stock consisted of\u000aa wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool,\u000ayoung Jerry, walking at his father\u2019s side, carried every morning to\u000abeneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where,\u000awith the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned\u000afrom any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man\u2019s\u000afeet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr.\u000aCruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar\u000aitself,--and was almost as in-looking.\u000a\u000aEncamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his\u000athree-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson\u2019s,\u000aJerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry\u000astanding by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to\u000ainflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing\u000aboys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,\u000aextremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic\u000ain Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two\u000aeyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.\u000aThe resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that\u000athe mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the\u000ayouthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else\u000ain Fleet-street.\u000a\u000aThe head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson\u2019s\u000aestablishment was put through the door, and the word was given:\u000a\u000a\u201cPorter wanted!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHooray, father! Here\u2019s an early job to begin with!\u201d\u000a\u000aHaving thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on\u000athe stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father\u000ahad been chewing, and cogitated.\u000a\u000a\u201cAl-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!\u201d muttered young Jerry.\u000a\u201cWhere does my father get all that iron rust from? He don\u2019t get no iron\u000arust here!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aII. A Sight\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?\u201d said one of the oldest of\u000aclerks to Jerry the messenger.\u000a\u000a\u201cYe-es, sir,\u201d returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. \u201cI _do_\u000aknow the Bailey.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJust so. And you know Mr. Lorry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much\u000abetter,\u201d said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment\u000ain question, \u201cthan I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVery well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the\u000adoor-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cInto the court, sir?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cInto the court.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher\u2019s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to\u000ainterchange the inquiry, \u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAm I to wait in the court, sir?\u201d he asked, as the result of that\u000aconference.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.\u000aLorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry\u2019s\u000aattention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,\u000ato remain there until he wants you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs that all, sir?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him\u000ayou are there.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,\u000aMr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the\u000ablotting-paper stage, remarked:\u000a\u000a\u201cI suppose they\u2019ll be trying Forgeries this morning?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTreason!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s quartering,\u201d said Jerry. \u201cBarbarous!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is the law,\u201d remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised\u000aspectacles upon him. \u201cIt is the law.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It\u2019s hard enough to kill\u000ahim, but it\u2019s wery hard to spile him, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot at all,\u201d retained the ancient clerk. \u201cSpeak well of the law. Take\u000acare of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take\u000acare of itself. I give you that advice.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,\u201d said Jerry. \u201cI\u000aleave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the old clerk; \u201cwe all have our various ways of\u000againing a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry\u000aways. Here is the letter. Go along.\u201d\u000a\u000aJerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal\u000adeference than he made an outward show of, \u201cYou are a lean old one,\u000atoo,\u201d made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination,\u000aand went his way.\u000a\u000aThey hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had\u000anot obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.\u000aBut, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and\u000avillainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came\u000ainto court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the\u000adock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It\u000ahad more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced\u000ahis own doom as certainly as the prisoner\u2019s, and even died before him.\u000aFor the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,\u000afrom which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on\u000aa violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a\u000ahalf of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.\u000aSo powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It\u000awas famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted\u000aa punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for\u000athe whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and\u000asoftening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in\u000ablood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically\u000aleading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed\u000aunder Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice\u000aillustration of the precept, that \u201cWhatever is is right;\u201d an aphorism\u000athat would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome\u000aconsequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.\u000a\u000aMaking his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this\u000ahideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his\u000away quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in\u000ahis letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play\u000aat the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the\u000aformer entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey\u000adoors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the\u000acriminals got there, and those were always left wide open.\u000a\u000aAfter some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a\u000avery little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into\u000acourt.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s on?\u201d he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next\u000ato.\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing yet.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s coming on?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Treason case.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe quartering one, eh?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh!\u201d returned the man, with a relish; \u201che\u2019ll be drawn on a hurdle to\u000abe half hanged, and then he\u2019ll be taken down and sliced before his own\u000aface, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,\u000aand then his head will be chopped off, and he\u2019ll be cut into quarters.\u000aThat\u2019s the sentence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf he\u2019s found Guilty, you mean to say?\u201d Jerry added, by way of proviso.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! they\u2019ll find him guilty,\u201d said the other. \u201cDon\u2019t you be afraid of\u000athat.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher\u2019s attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he\u000asaw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand. Mr. Lorry\u000asat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged\u000agentleman, the prisoner\u2019s counsel, who had a great bundle of papers\u000abefore him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands\u000ain his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him\u000athen or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the\u000acourt. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing\u000awith his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up\u000ato look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s _he_ got to do with the case?\u201d asked the man he had spoken with.\u000a\u000a\u201cBlest if I know,\u201d said Jerry.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBlest if I know that either,\u201d said Jerry.\u000a\u000aThe entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling\u000adown in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the\u000acentral point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,\u000awent out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.\u000a\u000aEverybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the\u000aceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled\u000aat him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round\u000apillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows\u000astood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,\u000alaid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help\u000athemselves, at anybody\u2019s cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got\u000aupon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.\u000aConspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall\u000aof Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a\u000awhet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with\u000athe waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,\u000athat flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him\u000ain an impure mist and rain.\u000a\u000aThe object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about\u000afive-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and\u000aa dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly\u000adressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and\u000adark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out\u000aof his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express\u000aitself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his\u000asituation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the\u000asoul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed,\u000abowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.\u000a\u000aThe sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,\u000awas not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a less\u000ahorrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage\u000adetails being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his\u000afascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,\u000awas the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered\u000aand torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various\u000aspectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and\u000apowers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.\u000a\u000aSilence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to\u000aan indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that\u000ahe was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so\u000aforth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers\u000aoccasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French\u000aKing, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and\u000aso forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of\u000aour said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the\u000asaid French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise\u000aevil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our\u000asaid serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation\u000ato send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head\u000abecoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with\u000ahuge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that\u000athe aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood\u000athere before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and\u000athat Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.\u000a\u000aThe accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged,\u000abeheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from\u000athe situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and\u000aattentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;\u000aand stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so\u000acomposedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which\u000ait was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with\u000avinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.\u000a\u000aOver the prisoner\u2019s head there was a mirror, to throw the light down\u000aupon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in\u000ait, and had passed from its surface and this earth\u2019s together. Haunted\u000ain a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the\u000aglass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one\u000aday to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace\u000afor which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner\u2019s mind. Be\u000athat as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar\u000aof light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his\u000aface flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.\u000a\u000aIt happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court\u000awhich was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat,\u000ain that corner of the Judge\u2019s bench, two persons upon whom his look\u000aimmediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his\u000aaspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.\u000a\u000aThe spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than\u000atwenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very\u000aremarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair,\u000aand a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,\u000abut pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he\u000alooked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as\u000ait was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a\u000ahandsome man, not past the prime of life.\u000a\u000aHis daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by\u000ahim, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him, in her\u000adread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had\u000abeen strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion\u000athat saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very\u000anoticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who\u000ahad had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about,\u000a\u201cWho are they?\u201d\u000a\u000aJerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own\u000amanner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his\u000aabsorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about\u000ahim had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and\u000afrom him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got\u000ato Jerry:\u000a\u000a\u201cWitnesses.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor which side?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAgainst.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAgainst what side?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe prisoner\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them,\u000aleaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was\u000ain his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the\u000aaxe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIII. A Disappointment\u000a\u000a\u000aMr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before\u000athem, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which\u000aclaimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the\u000apublic enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or\u000aeven of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the\u000aprisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and\u000arepassing between France and England, on secret business of which\u000ahe could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of\u000atraitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real\u000awickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.\u000aThat Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who\u000awas beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the\u000aprisoner\u2019s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his\u000aMajesty\u2019s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.\u000aThat, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and\u000aattitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner\u2019s\u000afriend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his\u000ainfamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish\u000ain his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues\u000awere decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public\u000abenefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as\u000athey were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue,\u000aas had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well\u000aknew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues;\u000awhereat the jury\u2019s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that\u000athey knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more\u000aespecially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.\u000aThat, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness\u000afor the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had\u000acommunicated itself to the prisoner\u2019s servant, and had engendered in him\u000aa holy determination to examine his master\u2019s table-drawers and pockets,\u000aand secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to\u000ahear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,\u000ain a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General\u2019s)\u000abrothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.\u000aAttorney-General\u2019s) father and mother. That, he called with confidence\u000aon the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two\u000awitnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be\u000aproduced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of\u000ahis Majesty\u2019s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by\u000asea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed\u000asuch information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be\u000aproved to be in the prisoner\u2019s handwriting; but that it was all the\u000asame; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as\u000ashowing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof\u000awould go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged\u000ain these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the\u000avery first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.\u000aThat, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they\u000awere), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must\u000apositively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether\u000athey liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their\u000apillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying\u000atheir heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion\u000aof their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that\u000athere never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon\u000apillows at all, unless the prisoner\u2019s head was taken off. That head\u000aMr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of\u000aeverything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith\u000aof his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as\u000agood as dead and gone.\u000a\u000aWhen the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if\u000aa cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in\u000aanticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the\u000aunimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.\u000a\u000aMr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader\u2019s lead, examined the\u000apatriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul was\u000aexactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if\u000ait had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom\u000aof its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the\u000awigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.\u000aLorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting\u000aopposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.\u000a\u000aHad he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinuation.\u000aWhat did he live upon? His property. Where was his property? He didn\u2019t\u000aprecisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of anybody\u2019s.\u000aHad he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very\u000adistant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtors\u2019\u000aprison? Didn\u2019t see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtors\u2019\u000aprison?--Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three\u000atimes. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever\u000abeen kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs?\u000aDecidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell\u000adownstairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at\u000adice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who\u000acommitted the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true?\u000aPositively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not\u000amore than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes.\u000aEver pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a\u000avery slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?\u000aNo. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more\u000aabout the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No.\u000aExpect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government\u000apay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear\u000ano. Swear that? Over and over again. No motives but motives of sheer\u000apatriotism? None whatever.\u000a\u000aThe virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a\u000agreat rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and\u000asimplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais\u000apacket, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.\u000aHe had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of\u000acharity--never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of\u000athe prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging\u000ahis clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the\u000aprisoner\u2019s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from\u000athe drawer of the prisoner\u2019s desk. He had not put them there first. He\u000ahad seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen\u000aat Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and\u000aBoulogne. He loved his country, and couldn\u2019t bear it, and had given\u000ainformation. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;\u000ahe had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be\u000aonly a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;\u000athat was merely a coincidence. He didn\u2019t call it a particularly curious\u000acoincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a\u000acurious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too. He\u000awas a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.\u000a\u000aThe blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis\u000aLorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson\u2019s bank?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOn a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and\u000aseventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and\u000aDover by the mail?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWere there any other passengers in the mail?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTwo.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid they alight on the road in the course of the night?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot undertake to say that he was.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDoes he resemble either of these two passengers?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBoth were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so\u000areserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up as\u000athose two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to\u000arender it unlikely that he was one of them?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo at least you say he may have been one of them?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes. Except that I remember them both to have been--like\u000amyself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous\u000aair.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI certainly have seen that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him, to your\u000acertain knowledge, before?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the\u000aprisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the\u000avoyage with me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt what hour did he come on board?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt a little after midnight.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on board\u000aat that untimely hour?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe happened to be the only one.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNever mind about \u2018happening,\u2019 Mr. Lorry. He was the only passenger who\u000acame on board in the dead of the night?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe was.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWere you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and\u000aI lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Manette!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now\u000aturned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her, and\u000akept her hand drawn through his arm.\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Manette, look upon the prisoner.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was\u000afar more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.\u000aStanding, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all\u000athe staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him\u000ato remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs\u000abefore him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts\u000ato control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour\u000arushed to his heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOn board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same\u000aoccasion.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are the young lady just now referred to?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cO! most unhappily, I am!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice\u000aof the Judge, as he said something fiercely: \u201cAnswer the questions put\u000ato you, and make no remark upon them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that\u000apassage across the Channel?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cRecall it.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: \u201cWhen the\u000agentleman came on board--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you mean the prisoner?\u201d inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, my Lord.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen say the prisoner.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,\u201d turning\u000aher eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, \u201cwas much fatigued\u000aand in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was\u000aafraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the\u000adeck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take\u000acare of him. There were no other passengers that night, but we four.\u000aThe prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could\u000ashelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I\u000ahad not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would\u000aset when we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed\u000agreat gentleness and kindness for my father\u2019s state, and I am sure he\u000afelt it. That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow many were with him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTwo French gentlemen.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHad they conferred together?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey had conferred together until the last moment, when it was\u000anecessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHad any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSome papers had been handed about among them, but I don\u2019t know what\u000apapers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLike these in shape and size?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPossibly, but indeed I don\u2019t know, although they stood whispering very\u000anear to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the\u000alight of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they\u000aspoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that\u000athey looked at papers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, to the prisoner\u2019s conversation, Miss Manette.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe prisoner was as open in his confidence with me--which arose out\u000aof my helpless situation--as he was kind, and good, and useful to my\u000afather. I hope,\u201d bursting into tears, \u201cI may not repay him by doing him\u000aharm to-day.\u201d\u000a\u000aBuzzing from the blue-flies.\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that\u000ayou give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must\u000agive--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness,\u000ahe is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and\u000adifficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was\u000atherefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business\u000ahad, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals,\u000atake him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long\u000atime to come.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said\u000athat, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on\u000aEngland\u2019s part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George\u000aWashington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the\u000aThird. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said\u000alaughingly, and to beguile the time.\u201d\u000a\u000aAny strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in\u000aa scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be\u000aunconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully\u000aanxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when\u000ashe stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon\u000athe counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same\u000aexpression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority\u000aof the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,\u000awhen the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous\u000aheresy about George Washington.\u000a\u000aMr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it\u000anecessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady\u2019s\u000afather, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.\u000a\u000a\u201cDoctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOnce. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or\u000athree years and a half ago.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCan you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or\u000aspeak to his conversation with your daughter?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSir, I can do neither.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do\u000aeither?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe answered, in a low voice, \u201cThere is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHas it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without\u000atrial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe answered, in a tone that went to every heart, \u201cA long imprisonment.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWere you newly released on the occasion in question?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey tell me so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHave you no remembrance of the occasion?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNone. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what\u000atime--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the\u000atime when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter\u000ahere. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored\u000amy faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become\u000afamiliar. I have no remembrance of the process.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down\u000atogether.\u000a\u000aA singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand being\u000ato show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked,\u000ain the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and\u000agot out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did\u000anot remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more,\u000ato a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness\u000awas called to identify him as having been at the precise time required,\u000ain the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town,\u000awaiting for another person. The prisoner\u2019s counsel was cross-examining\u000athis witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner\u000aon any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time\u000abeen looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a\u000alittle piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening\u000athis piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great\u000aattention and curiosity at the prisoner.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe witness was quite sure.\u000a\u000a\u201cDid you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?\u201d\u000a\u000aNot so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.\u000a\u000a\u201cLook well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,\u201d pointing\u000ato him who had tossed the paper over, \u201cand then look well upon the\u000aprisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?\u201d\u000a\u000aAllowing for my learned friend\u2019s appearance being careless and slovenly\u000aif not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,\u000anot only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought\u000ainto comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside\u000ahis wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became\u000amuch more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner\u2019s\u000acounsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned\u000afriend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he\u000awould ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might\u000ahappen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen\u000athis illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so\u000aconfident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to smash\u000athis witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to\u000auseless lumber.\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his\u000afingers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while Mr.\u000aStryver fitted the prisoner\u2019s case on the jury, like a compact suit\u000aof clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and\u000atraitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest\u000ascoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look\u000arather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner,\u000aand was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false\u000aswearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family\u000aaffairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making\u000athose passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a\u000aconsideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him,\u000aeven for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped\u000aand wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they\u000ahad witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent\u000agallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman\u000aand young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that\u000areference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and\u000aimpossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.\u000aHow it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this\u000aattempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies\u000aand fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it;\u000ahow, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous\u000acharacter of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the\u000aState Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed\u000a(with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could\u000anot sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.\u000a\u000aMr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to\u000aattend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr.\u000aStryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and\u000aCly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the\u000aprisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning\u000athe suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole\u000adecidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.\u000a\u000aAnd now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.\u000a\u000aMr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,\u000achanged neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.\u000aWhile his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him,\u000awhispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced\u000aanxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and\u000agrouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,\u000aand slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion\u000ain the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man\u000asat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put\u000aon just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his\u000ahands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all\u000aday. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him\u000aa disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he\u000aundoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,\u000awhen they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the\u000alookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would\u000ahardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the\u000aobservation to his next neighbour, and added, \u201cI\u2019d hold half a guinea\u000athat _he_ don\u2019t get no law-work to do. Don\u2019t look like the sort of one\u000ato get any, do he?\u201d\u000a\u000aYet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he\u000aappeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette\u2019s head dropped upon\u000aher father\u2019s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly:\u000a\u201cOfficer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out.\u000aDon\u2019t you see she will fall!\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much\u000asympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to\u000ahim, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown\u000astrong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or\u000abrooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,\u000aever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a\u000amoment, spoke, through their foreman.\u000a\u000aThey were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George\u000aWashington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed,\u000abut signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,\u000aand retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in\u000athe court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the\u000ajury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get\u000arefreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat\u000adown.\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out,\u000anow reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest,\u000acould easily get near him.\u000a\u000a\u201cJerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the\u000away. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don\u2019t be a moment\u000abehind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You\u000aare the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long\u000abefore I can.\u201d\u000a\u000aJerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in\u000aacknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up\u000aat the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow is the young lady?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she\u000afeels the better for being out of court.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ll tell the prisoner so. It won\u2019t do for a respectable bank gentleman\u000alike you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point\u000ain his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar.\u000aThe way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all\u000aeyes, ears, and spikes.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Darnay!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe prisoner came forward directly.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She\u000awill do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so\u000afor me, with my fervent acknowledgments?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, I could. I will, if you ask it.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Carton\u2019s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He stood,\u000ahalf turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat,\u201d said Carton, still only half turned towards him, \u201cdo you expect,\u000aMr. Darnay?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe worst.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their\u000awithdrawing is in your favour.\u201d\u000a\u000aLoitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no\u000amore: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other\u000ain manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above\u000athem.\u000a\u000aAn hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded\u000apassages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.\u000aThe hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that\u000arefection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide\u000aof people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along\u000awith them.\u000a\u000a\u201cJerry! Jerry!\u201d Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got\u000athere.\u000a\u000a\u201cHere, sir! It\u2019s a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. \u201cQuick! Have you got\u000ait?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000aHastily written on the paper was the word \u201cACQUITTED.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you had sent the message, \u2018Recalled to Life,\u2019 again,\u201d muttered\u000aJerry, as he turned, \u201cI should have known what you meant, this time.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else,\u000auntil he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out\u000awith a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz\u000aswept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in\u000asearch of other carrion.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIV. Congratulatory\u000a\u000a\u000aFrom the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the\u000ahuman stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when\u000aDoctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor\u000afor the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.\u000aCharles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from\u000adeath.\u000a\u000aIt would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise\u000ain Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the\u000ashoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him\u000atwice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation\u000ahad not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and\u000ato the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent\u000areason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long\u000alingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition\u000afrom the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of\u000aitself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those\u000aunacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual\u000aBastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three\u000ahundred miles away.\u000a\u000aOnly his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from\u000ahis mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his\u000amisery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,\u000athe light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial\u000ainfluence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could\u000arecall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few\u000aand slight, and she believed them over.\u000a\u000aMr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned\u000ato Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little\u000amore than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,\u000aloud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing\u000away of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and\u000aconversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.\u000a\u000aHe still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his\u000alate client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean\u000aout of the group: \u201cI am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.\u000aDarnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the\u000aless likely to succeed on that account.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,\u201d\u000a said his late client, taking his hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as\u000aanother man\u2019s, I believe.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt clearly being incumbent on some one to say, \u201cMuch better,\u201d Mr. Lorry\u000asaid it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested\u000aobject of squeezing himself back again.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou think so?\u201d said Mr. Stryver. \u201cWell! you have been present all day,\u000aand you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd as such,\u201d quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had\u000anow shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered\u000ahim out of it--\u201cas such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up\u000athis conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.\u000aDarnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Stryver; \u201cI have a night\u2019s work to\u000ado yet. Speak for yourself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI speak for myself,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, \u201cand for Mr. Darnay, and for\u000aMiss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?\u201d\u000a He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.\u000a\u000aHis face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at\u000aDarnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,\u000anot even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his\u000athoughts had wandered away.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy father,\u201d said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.\u000a\u000aHe slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.\u000a\u000a\u201cShall we go home, my father?\u201d\u000a\u000aWith a long breath, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the\u000aimpression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be\u000areleased that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the\u000apassages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,\u000aand the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning\u2019s interest of\u000agallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.\u000aWalking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into\u000athe open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter\u000adeparted in it.\u000a\u000aMr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back\u000ato the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or\u000ainterchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning\u000aagainst the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled\u000aout after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now\u000astepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?\u201d\u000a\u000aNobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton\u2019s part in the day\u2019s\u000aproceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the\u000abetter for it in appearance.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the\u000abusiness mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business\u000aappearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, \u201cYou have mentioned that before,\u000asir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We\u000ahave to think of the House more than ourselves.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_I_ know, _I_ know,\u201d rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. \u201cDon\u2019t be\u000anettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better,\u000aI dare say.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd indeed, sir,\u201d pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, \u201cI really don\u2019t\u000aknow what you have to do with the matter. If you\u2019ll excuse me, as very\u000amuch your elder, for saying so, I really don\u2019t know that it is your\u000abusiness.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBusiness! Bless you, _I_ have no business,\u201d said Mr. Carton.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a pity you have not, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think so, too.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you had,\u201d pursued Mr. Lorry, \u201cperhaps you would attend to it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLord love you, no!--I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Mr. Carton.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, sir!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,\u000a\u201cbusiness is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,\u000aif business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.\u000aDarnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance\u000afor that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!\u000aI hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy\u000alife.--Chair there!\u201d\u000a\u000aPerhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.\u000aLorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson\u2019s. Carton,\u000awho smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed\u000athen, and turned to Darnay:\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must\u000abe a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on\u000athese street stones?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hardly seem yet,\u201d returned Charles Darnay, \u201cto belong to this world\u000aagain.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t wonder at it; it\u2019s not so long since you were pretty far\u000aadvanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI begin to think I _am_ faint.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen why the devil don\u2019t you dine? I dined, myself, while those\u000anumskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or\u000asome other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.\u201d\u000a\u000aDrawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to\u000aFleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were\u000ashown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting\u000ahis strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat\u000aopposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port\u000abefore him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.\u000aDarnay?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far\u000amended as to feel that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt must be an immense satisfaction!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large\u000aone.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.\u000aIt has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we\u000aare not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are\u000anot much alike in any particular, you and I.\u201d\u000a\u000aConfused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with\u000athis Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was\u000aat a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow your dinner is done,\u201d Carton presently said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you call a\u000ahealth, Mr. Darnay; why don\u2019t you give your toast?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat health? What toast?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, it\u2019s on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I\u2019ll\u000aswear it\u2019s there.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Manette, then!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Manette, then!\u201d\u000a\u000aLooking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton\u000aflung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to\u000apieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!\u201d\u000a he said, filling his new goblet.\u000a\u000aA slight frown and a laconic \u201cYes,\u201d were the answer.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it\u000afeel? Is it worth being tried for one\u2019s life, to be the object of such\u000asympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\u201d\u000a\u000aAgain Darnay answered not a word.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not\u000athat she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this\u000adisagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the\u000astrait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him\u000afor it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\u201d was the careless rejoinder.\u000a\u201cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don\u2019t know why I did\u000ait, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you think I particularly like you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cReally, Mr. Carton,\u201d returned the other, oddly disconcerted, \u201cI have\u000anot asked myself the question.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut ask yourself the question now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have acted as if you do; but I don\u2019t think you do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_I_ don\u2019t think I do,\u201d said Carton. \u201cI begin to have a very good\u000aopinion of your understanding.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNevertheless,\u201d pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, \u201cthere is\u000anothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our\u000aparting without ill-blood on either side.\u201d\u000a\u000aCarton rejoining, \u201cNothing in life!\u201d Darnay rang. \u201cDo you call the whole\u000areckoning?\u201d said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, \u201cThen\u000abring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at\u000aten.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.\u000aWithout returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat\u000aof defiance in his manner, and said, \u201cA last word, Mr. Darnay: you think\u000aI am drunk?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThink? You know I have been drinking.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSince I must say so, I know it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I\u000acare for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMuch to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMay be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don\u2019t let your sober face elate you,\u000ahowever; you don\u2019t know what it may come to. Good night!\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a\u000aglass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you particularly like the man?\u201d he muttered, at his own image; \u201cwhy\u000ashould you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing\u000ain you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have\u000amade in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you\u000awhat you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change\u000aplaces with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as\u000ahe was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and\u000ahave it out in plain words! You hate the fellow.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few\u000aminutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the\u000atable, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aV. The Jackal\u000a\u000a\u000aThose were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is\u000athe improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate\u000astatement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow\u000ain the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a\u000aperfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.\u000aThe learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other\u000alearned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr.\u000aStryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative\u000apractice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the\u000adrier parts of the legal race.\u000a\u000aA favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had\u000abegun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which\u000ahe mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite,\u000aspecially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the\u000avisage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the\u000aflorid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of\u000athe bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from\u000aamong a rank garden-full of flaring companions.\u000a\u000aIt had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib\u000aman, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that\u000afaculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is\u000aamong the most striking and necessary of the advocate\u2019s accomplishments.\u000aBut, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more\u000abusiness he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its\u000apith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney\u000aCarton, he always had his points at his fingers\u2019 ends in the morning.\u000a\u000aSydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver\u2019s great\u000aally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas,\u000amight have floated a king\u2019s ship. Stryver never had a case in hand,\u000aanywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring\u000aat the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there\u000athey prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was\u000arumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily\u000ato his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about,\u000aamong such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton\u000awould never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he\u000arendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.\u000a\u000a\u201cTen o\u2019clock, sir,\u201d said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to\u000awake him--\u201cten o\u2019clock, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_What\u2019s_ the matter?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTen o\u2019clock, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you mean? Ten o\u2019clock at night?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, sir. Your honour told me to call you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! I remember. Very well, very well.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man\u000adexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes,\u000ahe got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple,\u000aand, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King\u2019s\u000aBench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.\u000a\u000aThe Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone\u000ahome, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers on,\u000aand a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. He\u000ahad that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which\u000amay be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of\u000aJeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of\u000aArt, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are a little late, Memory,\u201d said Stryver.\u000a\u000a\u201cAbout the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers,\u000awhere there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in\u000athe midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon\u000ait, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTwo to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day\u2019s client; or\u000aseeing him dine--it\u2019s all one!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the\u000aidentification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have\u000abeen much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.\u201d\u000a\u000aSullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining\u000aroom, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel\u000aor two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them\u000aout, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down\u000aat the table, and said, \u201cNow I am ready!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,\u201d said Mr. Stryver,\u000agaily, as he looked among his papers.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow much?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly two sets of them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGive me the worst first.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere they are, Sydney. Fire away!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the\u000adrinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table\u000aproper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to\u000ahis hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in\u000aa different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in\u000ahis waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some\u000alighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,\u000aso deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he\u000astretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or\u000amore, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the\u000amatter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on\u000ahim to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the\u000ajug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as\u000ano words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious\u000agravity.\u000a\u000aAt length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and\u000aproceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,\u000amade his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal\u000aassisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his\u000ahands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then\u000ainvigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application\u000ato his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;\u000athis was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not\u000adisposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,\u201d said Mr.\u000aStryver.\u000a\u000aThe jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming\u000aagain, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses\u000ato-day. Every question told.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI always am sound; am I not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to\u000ait and smooth it again.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,\u201d said Stryver, nodding\u000ahis head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, \u201cthe\u000aold seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and\u000anow in despondency!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh!\u201d returned the other, sighing: \u201cyes! The same Sydney, with the same\u000aluck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd why not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGod knows. It was my way, I suppose.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before\u000ahim, looking at the fire.\u000a\u000a\u201cCarton,\u201d said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,\u000aas if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour\u000awas forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney\u000aCarton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, \u201cyour way\u000ais, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look\u000aat me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, botheration!\u201d returned Sydney, with a lighter and more\u000agood-humoured laugh, \u201cdon\u2019t _you_ be moral!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow have I done what I have done?\u201d said Stryver; \u201chow do I do what I\u000ado?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPartly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it\u2019s not worth\u000ayour while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to\u000ado, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,\u201d said\u000aCarton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.\u000a\u000a\u201cBefore Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,\u201d\u000a pursued Carton, \u201cyou have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into\u000amine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,\u000apicking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we\u000adidn\u2019t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always\u000anowhere.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd whose fault was that?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUpon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always\u000adriving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree\u000athat I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It\u2019s a gloomy\u000athing, however, to talk about one\u2019s own past, with the day breaking.\u000aTurn me in some other direction before I go.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,\u201d said Stryver, holding up\u000ahis glass. \u201cAre you turned in a pleasant direction?\u201d\u000a\u000aApparently not, for he became gloomy again.\u000a\u000a\u201cPretty witness,\u201d he muttered, looking down into his glass. \u201cI have had\u000aenough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who\u2019s your pretty witness?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe picturesque doctor\u2019s daughter, Miss Manette.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_She_ pretty?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs she not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cRot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge\u000aof beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you know, Sydney,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,\u000aand slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: \u201cdo you know, I rather\u000athought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,\u000aand were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cQuick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a\u000ayard or two of a man\u2019s nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.\u000aI pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I\u2019ll have no more drink;\u000aI\u2019ll get to bed.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light\u000ahim down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy\u000awindows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the\u000adull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a\u000alifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round\u000abefore the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and\u000athe first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.\u000a\u000aWaste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still\u000aon his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the\u000awilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and\u000aperseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries\u000afrom which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the\u000afruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.\u000aA moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of\u000ahouses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its\u000apillow was wet with wasted tears.\u000a\u000aSadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of\u000agood abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,\u000aincapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight\u000aon him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVI. Hundreds of People\u000a\u000a\u000aThe quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not\u000afar from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the\u000awaves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried\u000ait, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis\u000aLorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,\u000aon his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into\u000abusiness-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor\u2019s friend, and the\u000aquiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.\u000a\u000aOn this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in\u000athe afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine\u000aSundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;\u000asecondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with\u000athem as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and\u000agenerally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have\u000ahis own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the\u000aDoctor\u2019s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving\u000athem.\u000a\u000aA quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be\u000afound in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of\u000athe Doctor\u2019s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that\u000ahad a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,\u000anorth of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers\u000agrew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a\u000aconsequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,\u000ainstead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a\u000asettlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which\u000athe peaches ripened in their season.\u000a\u000aThe summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part\u000aof the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,\u000athough not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a\u000aglare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful\u000aplace for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.\u000a\u000aThere ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and\u000athere was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where\u000aseveral callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was\u000aaudible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In\u000aa building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree\u000arustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver\u000ato be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant\u000awho had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if\u000ahe had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all\u000avisitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured\u000ato live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have\u000aa counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray\u000aworkman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered\u000aabout there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a\u000athump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions\u000arequired to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind\u000athe house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way\u000afrom Sunday morning unto Saturday night.\u000a\u000aDoctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and\u000aits revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.\u000aHis scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting\u000aingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and\u000ahe earned as much as he wanted.\u000a\u000aThese things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry\u2019s knowledge, thoughts, and\u000anotice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,\u000aon the fine Sunday afternoon.\u000a\u000a\u201cDoctor Manette at home?\u201d\u000a\u000aExpected home.\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Lucie at home?\u201d\u000a\u000aExpected home.\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Pross at home?\u201d\u000a\u000aPossibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to\u000aanticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the\u000afact.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs I am at home myself,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cI\u2019ll go upstairs.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough the Doctor\u2019s daughter had known nothing of the country of her\u000abirth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to\u000amake much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most\u000aagreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off\u000aby so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,\u000athat its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the\u000arooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,\u000athe elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by\u000adelicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in\u000athemselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry\u000astood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,\u000awith something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this\u000atime, whether he approved?\u000a\u000aThere were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they\u000acommunicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them\u000aall, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which\u000ahe detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was\u000athe best room, and in it were Lucie\u2019s birds, and flowers, and books,\u000aand desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was\u000athe Doctor\u2019s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,\u000achangingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the\u000aDoctor\u2019s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker\u2019s\u000abench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the\u000adismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wonder,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, \u201cthat he keeps\u000athat reminder of his sufferings about him!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd why wonder at that?\u201d was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.\u000a\u000aIt proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose\u000aacquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and\u000ahad since improved.\u000a\u000a\u201cI should have thought--\u201d Mr. Lorry began.\u000a\u000a\u201cPooh! You\u2019d have thought!\u201d said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow do you do?\u201d inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to\u000aexpress that she bore him no malice.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am pretty well, I thank you,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; \u201chow\u000aare you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing to boast of,\u201d said Miss Pross.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh! indeed!\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cI am very much put out about my\u000aLadybird.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor gracious sake say something else besides \u2018indeed,\u2019 or you\u2019ll\u000afidget me to death,\u201d said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from\u000astature) was shortness.\u000a\u000a\u201cReally, then?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.\u000a\u000a\u201cReally, is bad enough,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cbut better. Yes, I am\u000avery much put out.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMay I ask the cause?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to\u000acome here looking after her,\u201d said Miss Pross.\u000a\u000a\u201c_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHundreds,\u201d said Miss Pross.\u000a\u000aIt was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her\u000atime and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,\u000ashe exaggerated it.\u000a\u000a\u201cDear me!\u201d said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and\u000apaid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take\u000ayour affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her\u000afor nothing--since she was ten years old. And it\u2019s really very hard,\u201d\u000a said Miss Pross.\u000a\u000aNot seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;\u000ausing that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would\u000afit anything.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,\u000aare always turning up,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cWhen you began it--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_I_ began it, Miss Pross?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDidn\u2019t you? Who brought her father to life?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! If _that_ was beginning it--\u201d said Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt wasn\u2019t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard\u000aenough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except\u000athat he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on\u000ahim, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any\u000acircumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds\u000aand multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven\u000ahim), to take Ladybird\u2019s affections away from me.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by\u000athis time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those\u000aunselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and\u000aadmiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost\u000ait, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were\u000anever fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon\u000atheir own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there\u000ais nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so\u000arendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted\u000arespect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own\u000amind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss\u000aPross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably\u000abetter got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson\u2019s.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,\u201d said\u000aMiss Pross; \u201cand that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn\u2019t made a\u000amistake in life.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere again: Mr. Lorry\u2019s inquiries into Miss Pross\u2019s personal history had\u000aestablished the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel\u000awho had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to\u000aspeculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with\u000ano touch of compunction. Miss Pross\u2019s fidelity of belief in Solomon\u000a(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious\u000amatter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of\u000abusiness,\u201d he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had\u000asat down there in friendly relations, \u201clet me ask you--does the Doctor,\u000ain talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNever.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh!\u201d returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. \u201cBut I don\u2019t say he don\u2019t\u000arefer to it within himself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you believe that he thinks of it much?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do,\u201d said Miss Pross.\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you imagine--\u201d Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up\u000ashort with:\u000a\u000a\u201cNever imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,\u000asometimes?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow and then,\u201d said Miss Pross.\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you suppose,\u201d Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his\u000abright eye, as it looked kindly at her, \u201cthat Doctor Manette has any\u000atheory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to\u000athe cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his\u000aoppressor?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd that is--?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat she thinks he has.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow don\u2019t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a\u000amere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDull?\u201d Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.\u000a\u000aRather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, \u201cNo, no,\u000ano. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor\u000aManette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured\u000ahe is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,\u000athough he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now\u000aintimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly\u000aattached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss\u000aPross, I don\u2019t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of\u000azealous interest.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell! To the best of my understanding, and bad\u2019s the best, you\u2019ll tell\u000ame,\u201d said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, \u201che is afraid\u000aof the whole subject.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAfraid?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It\u2019s a dreadful\u000aremembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not\u000aknowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never\u000afeel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn\u2019t make the\u000asubject pleasant, I should think.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. \u201cTrue,\u201d said\u000ahe, \u201cand fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss\u000aPross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression\u000aalways shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness\u000ait sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCan\u2019t be helped,\u201d said Miss Pross, shaking her head. \u201cTouch that\u000astring, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.\u000aIn short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in\u000athe dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking\u000aup and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to\u000aknow then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in\u000ahis old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up\u000aand down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says\u000aa word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it\u000abest not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down\u000atogether, walking up and down together, till her love and company have\u000abrought him to himself.\u201d\u000a\u000aNotwithstanding Miss Pross\u2019s denial of her own imagination, there was a\u000aperception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,\u000ain her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to\u000aher possessing such a thing.\u000a\u000aThe corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it\u000ahad begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it\u000aseemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had\u000aset it going.\u000a\u000a\u201cHere they are!\u201d said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;\u000a\u201cand now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a\u000apeculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,\u000alooking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied\u000athey would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though\u000athe steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be\u000aheard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close\u000aat hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross\u000awas ready at the street door to receive them.\u000a\u000aMiss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking\u000aoff her darling\u2019s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up\u000awith the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and\u000afolding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with\u000aas much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she\u000ahad been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant\u000asight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against\u000aher taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do\u000aplayfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own\u000achamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at\u000athem, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with\u000aeyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would\u000ahave had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,\u000abeaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor\u000astars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no\u000aHundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain\u000afor the fulfilment of Miss Pross\u2019s prediction.\u000a\u000aDinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of\u000athe little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and\u000aalways acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest\u000aquality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their\u000acontrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be\u000abetter. Miss Pross\u2019s friendship being of the thoroughly practical\u000akind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of\u000aimpoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would\u000aimpart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters\u000aof Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl\u000awho formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,\u000aor Cinderella\u2019s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,\u000aa vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she\u000apleased.\u000a\u000aOn Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor\u2019s table, but on other days\u000apersisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower\u000aregions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to\u000awhich no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,\u000aMiss Pross, responding to Ladybird\u2019s pleasant face and pleasant efforts\u000ato please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.\u000a\u000aIt was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the\u000awine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit\u000athere in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,\u000athey went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for\u000athe special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some\u000atime before, as Mr. Lorry\u2019s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the\u000aplane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs\u000aand ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree\u000awhispered to them in its own way above their heads.\u000a\u000aStill, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay\u000apresented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he\u000awas only One.\u000a\u000aDoctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross\u000asuddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and\u000aretired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this\u000adisorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, \u201ca fit of the\u000ajerks.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The\u000aresemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as\u000athey sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting\u000ahis arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the\u000alikeness.\u000a\u000aHe had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual\u000avivacity. \u201cPray, Doctor Manette,\u201d said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the\u000aplane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,\u000awhich happened to be the old buildings of London--\u201chave you seen much of\u000athe Tower?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of\u000ait, to know that it teems with interest; little more.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_I_ have been there, as you remember,\u201d said Darnay, with a smile,\u000athough reddening a little angrily, \u201cin another character, and not in a\u000acharacter that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a\u000acurious thing when I was there.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Lucie asked.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which\u000ahad been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of\u000aits inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by\u000aprisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone\u000ain an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to\u000aexecution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with\u000asome very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.\u000aAt first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully\u000aexamined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or\u000alegend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses\u000awere made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested\u000athat the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The\u000afloor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the\u000aearth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found\u000athe ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case\u000aor bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he\u000ahad written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy father,\u201d exclaimed Lucie, \u201cyou are ill!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and\u000ahis look quite terrified them all.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they\u000amade me start. We had better go in.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large\u000adrops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he\u000asaid not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told\u000aof, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry\u000aeither detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned\u000atowards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it\u000awhen it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.\u000a\u000aHe recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of\u000ahis business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more\u000asteady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he\u000awas not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and\u000athat the rain had startled him.\u000a\u000aTea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon\u000aher, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he\u000amade only Two.\u000a\u000aThe night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and\u000awindows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was\u000adone with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the\u000aheavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton\u000aleaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of\u000athe thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the\u000aceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,\u201d said Doctor\u000aManette. \u201cIt comes slowly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt comes surely,\u201d said Carton.\u000a\u000aThey spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a\u000adark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.\u000a\u000aThere was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to\u000aget shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes\u000aresounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a\u000afootstep was there.\u000a\u000a\u201cA multitude of people, and yet a solitude!\u201d said Darnay, when they had\u000alistened for a while.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?\u201d asked Lucie. \u201cSometimes, I have\u000asat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of\u000aa foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and\u000asolemn--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet us shudder too. We may know what it is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we\u000aoriginate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have\u000asometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made\u000athe echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming\u000aby-and-bye into our lives.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,\u201d\u000a Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.\u000a\u000aThe footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more\u000arapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,\u000aas it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some\u000acoming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in\u000athe distant streets, and not one within sight.\u000a\u000a\u201cAre all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or\u000aare we to divide them among us?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you\u000aasked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and\u000athen I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come\u000ainto my life, and my father\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI take them into mine!\u201d said Carton. \u201c_I_ ask no questions and make no\u000astipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,\u000aand I see them--by the Lightning.\u201d He added the last words, after there\u000ahad been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I hear them!\u201d he added again, after a peal of thunder. \u201cHere they\u000acome, fast, fierce, and furious!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,\u000afor no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and\u000alightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment\u2019s\u000ainterval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at\u000amidnight.\u000a\u000aThe great bell of Saint Paul\u2019s was striking one in the cleared air, when\u000aMr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set\u000aforth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches\u000aof road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful\u000aof foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was\u000ausually performed a good two hours earlier.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cto\u000abring the dead out of their graves.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don\u2019t expect to--what\u000awould do that,\u201d answered Jerry.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood night, Mr. Carton,\u201d said the man of business. \u201cGood night, Mr.\u000aDarnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!\u201d\u000a\u000aPerhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar,\u000abearing down upon them, too.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVII. Monseigneur in Town\u000a\u000a\u000aMonseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his\u000afortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in\u000ahis inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to\u000athe crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur\u000awas about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many\u000athings with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather\u000arapidly swallowing France; but, his morning\u2019s chocolate could not so\u000amuch as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four\u000astrong men besides the Cook.\u000a\u000aYes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the\u000aChief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his\u000apocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to\u000aconduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur\u2019s lips. One lacquey carried\u000athe chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed\u000athe chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;\u000aa third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold\u000awatches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to\u000adispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high\u000aplace under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon\u000ahis escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three\u000amen; he must have died of two.\u000a\u000aMonseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy\u000aand the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at\u000aa little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so\u000aimpressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far\u000amore influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and\u000astate secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance\u000afor France, as the like always is for all countries similarly\u000afavoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted\u000adays of the merry Stuart who sold it.\u000a\u000aMonseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which\u000awas, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public\u000abusiness, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go\u000ahis way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and\u000aparticular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world\u000awas made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original\u000aby only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: \u201cThe earth and the fulness\u000athereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into\u000ahis affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of\u000aaffairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances\u000apublic, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and\u000amust consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances\u000aprivate, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after\u000agenerations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence\u000aMonseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet\u000atime to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could\u000awear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,\u000apoor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with\u000aa golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer\u000arooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior\u000amankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked\u000adown upon him with the loftiest contempt.\u000a\u000aA sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his\u000astables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women\u000awaited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and\u000aforage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial\u000arelations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality\u000aamong the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.\u000a\u000aFor, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with\u000aevery device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could\u000aachieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any\u000areference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not\u000aso far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost\u000aequidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would\u000ahave been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have\u000abeen anybody\u2019s business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers\u000adestitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;\u000acivil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the\u000aworst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;\u000aall totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in\u000apretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of\u000aMonseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which\u000aanything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the\u000ascore. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,\u000ayet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives\u000apassed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were\u000ano less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies\u000afor imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly\u000apatients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had\u000adiscovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the\u000aState was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to\u000aroot out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears\u000athey could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving\u000aPhilosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making\u000acard-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving\u000aChemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this\u000awonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of\u000athe finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been\u000asince--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural\u000asubject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of\u000aexhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various\u000anotabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies\u000aamong the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half\u000aof the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among\u000athe angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and\u000aappearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of\u000abringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far\u000atowards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing\u000aknown to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,\u000aand brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and\u000asupped as at twenty.\u000a\u000aThe leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance\u000aupon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional\u000apeople who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that\u000athings in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting\u000athem right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic\u000asect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves\u000awhether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the\u000aspot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the\u000aFuture, for Monseigneur\u2019s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other\u000athree who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a\u000ajargon about \u201cthe Centre of Truth:\u201d holding that Man had got out of the\u000aCentre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got\u000aout of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of\u000athe Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,\u000aby fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much\u000adiscoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never\u000abecame manifest.\u000a\u000aBut, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of\u000aMonseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been\u000aascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally\u000acorrect. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such\u000adelicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant\u000aswords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would\u000asurely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen\u000aof the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they\u000alanguidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;\u000aand what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and\u000afine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and\u000ahis devouring hunger far away.\u000a\u000aDress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all\u000athings in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that\u000awas never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through\u000aMonseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals\u000aof Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball\u000adescended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was\u000arequired to officiate \u201cfrizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,\u000aand white silk stockings.\u201d At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a\u000ararity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother\u000aProfessors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call\u000ahim, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at\u000aMonseigneur\u2019s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year\u000aof our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled\u000ahangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would\u000asee the very stars out!\u000a\u000aMonseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his\u000achocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown\u000aopen, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and\u000afawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in\u000abody and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have\u000abeen one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never\u000atroubled it.\u000a\u000aBestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one\u000ahappy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably\u000apassed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of\u000aTruth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due\u000acourse of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate\u000asprites, and was seen no more.\u000a\u000aThe show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,\u000aand the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon\u000abut one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm\u000aand his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his\u000away out.\u000a\u000a\u201cI devote you,\u201d said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,\u000aand turning in the direction of the sanctuary, \u201cto the Devil!\u201d\u000a\u000aWith that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the\u000adust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.\u000a\u000aHe was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and\u000awith a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every\u000afeature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,\u000abeautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top\u000aof each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little\u000achange that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing\u000acolour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted\u000aby something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of\u000atreachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with\u000aattention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the\u000aline of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much\u000atoo horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a\u000ahandsome face, and a remarkable one.\u000a\u000aIts owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and\u000adrove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had\u000astood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer\u000ain his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable\u000ato him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and\u000aoften barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were\u000acharging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no\u000acheck into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had\u000asometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,\u000athat, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician\u000acustom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a\u000abarbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second\u000atime, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were\u000aleft to get out of their difficulties as they could.\u000a\u000aWith a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of\u000aconsideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage\u000adashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming\u000abefore it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of\u000aits way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its\u000awheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a\u000anumber of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.\u000a\u000aBut for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have\u000astopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded\u000abehind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,\u000aand there were twenty hands at the horses\u2019 bridles.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat has gone wrong?\u201d said Monsieur, calmly looking out.\u000a\u000aA tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of\u000athe horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was\u000adown in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.\u000a\u000a\u201cPardon, Monsieur the Marquis!\u201d said a ragged and submissive man, \u201cit is\u000aa child.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cExcuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,\u000ainto a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly\u000agot up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the\u000aMarquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.\u000a\u000a\u201cKilled!\u201d shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at\u000atheir length above his head, and staring at him. \u201cDead!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was\u000anothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness\u000aand eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the\u000apeople say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they\u000aremained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat\u000aand tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes\u000aover them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.\u000a\u000aHe took out his purse.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is extraordinary to me,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you people cannot take care\u000aof yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in\u000athe way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give\u000ahim that.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads\u000acraned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The\u000atall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, \u201cDead!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest\u000amade way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,\u000asobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were\u000astooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They\u000awere as silent, however, as the men.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know all, I know all,\u201d said the last comer. \u201cBe a brave man, my\u000aGaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to\u000alive. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour\u000aas happily?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are a philosopher, you there,\u201d said the Marquis, smiling. \u201cHow do\u000athey call you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey call me Defarge.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOf what trade?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,\u201d said the Marquis,\u000athrowing him another gold coin, \u201cand spend it as you will. The horses\u000athere; are they right?\u201d\u000a\u000aWithout deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the\u000aMarquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the\u000aair of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had\u000apaid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly\u000adisturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.\u000a\u000a\u201cHold!\u201d said Monsieur the Marquis. \u201cHold the horses! Who threw that?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a\u000amoment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on\u000athe pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the\u000afigure of a dark stout woman, knitting.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou dogs!\u201d said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,\u000aexcept as to the spots on his nose: \u201cI would ride over any of you very\u000awillingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal\u000athrew at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he\u000ashould be crushed under the wheels.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of\u000awhat such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not\u000aa voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.\u000aBut the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the\u000aMarquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his\u000acontemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he\u000aleaned back in his seat again, and gave the word \u201cGo on!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick\u000asuccession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the\u000aDoctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the\u000awhole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats\u000ahad crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking\u000aon for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the\u000aspectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through\u000awhich they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and\u000abidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle\u000awhile it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running\u000aof the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who\u000ahad stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness\u000aof Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran\u000ainto evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,\u000atime and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together\u000ain their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all\u000athings ran their course.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVIII. Monseigneur in the Country\u000a\u000a\u000aA beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.\u000aPatches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas\u000aand beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On\u000ainanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent\u000atendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected\u000adisposition to give up, and wither away.\u000a\u000aMonsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been\u000alighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up\u000aa steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was\u000ano impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was\u000aoccasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting\u000asun.\u000a\u000aThe sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it\u000agained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. \u201cIt will\u000adie out,\u201d said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, \u201cdirectly.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the\u000aheavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down\u000ahill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed\u000aquickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow\u000aleft when the drag was taken off.\u000a\u000aBut, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village\u000aat the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a\u000achurch-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a\u000afortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects\u000aas the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was\u000acoming near home.\u000a\u000aThe village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor\u000atannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor\u000afountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All\u000aits people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,\u000ashredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the\u000afountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of\u000athe earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor,\u000awere not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax\u000afor the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be\u000apaid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until\u000athe wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.\u000a\u000aFew children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,\u000atheir choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest\u000aterms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;\u000aor captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.\u000a\u000aHeralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions\u2019\u000awhips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as\u000aif he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in\u000ahis travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the\u000afountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.\u000aHe looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow\u000asure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the\u000ameagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the\u000atruth through the best part of a hundred years.\u000a\u000aMonsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that\u000adrooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before\u000aMonseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces\u000adrooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender\u000aof the roads joined the group.\u000a\u000a\u201cBring me hither that fellow!\u201d said the Marquis to the courier.\u000a\u000aThe fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round\u000ato look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.\u000a\u000a\u201cI passed you on the road?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cComing up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, it is true.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat did you look at, so fixedly?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, I looked at the man.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the\u000acarriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat man, pig? And why look there?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho?\u201d demanded the traveller.\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, the man.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMay the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You\u000aknow all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of\u000aall the days of my life, I never saw him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSwinging by the chain? To be suffocated?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur.\u000aHis head hanging over--like this!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his\u000aface thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered\u000ahimself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,\u000awhite as a spectre, tall as a spectre!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all\u000aeyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur\u000athe Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his\u000aconscience.\u000a\u000a\u201cTruly, you did well,\u201d said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such\u000avermin were not to ruffle him, \u201cto see a thief accompanying my carriage,\u000aand not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur\u000aGabelle!\u201d\u000a\u000aMonsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary\u000aunited; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this\u000aexamination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an\u000aofficial manner.\u000a\u000a\u201cBah! Go aside!\u201d said Monsieur Gabelle.\u000a\u000a\u201cLay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village\u000ato-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDid he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen\u000aparticular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some\u000ahalf-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and\u000apresented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.\u000a\u000a\u201cDid the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as\u000aa person plunges into the river.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSee to it, Gabelle. Go on!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the\u000awheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky\u000ato save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or\u000athey might not have been so fortunate.\u000a\u000aThe burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the\u000arise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,\u000ait subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many\u000asweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer\u000agnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the\u000apoints to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the\u000acourier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.\u000a\u000aAt the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground,\u000awith a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor\u000afigure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had\u000astudied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was\u000adreadfully spare and thin.\u000a\u000aTo this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been\u000agrowing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She\u000aturned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and\u000apresented herself at the carriage-door.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,\u000aMonseigneur looked out.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow, then! What is it? Always petitions!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He\u000acannot pay something?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAlas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor\u000agrass.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAgain, well?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate\u000agrief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together\u000awith wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly,\u000acaressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to\u000afeel the appealing touch.\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of\u000awant; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAgain, well? Can I feed them?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, the good God knows; but I don\u2019t ask it. My petition is,\u000athat a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband\u2019s name, may be placed\u000aover him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly\u000aforgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I\u000ashall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they\u000aare so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. Monseigneur!\u000aMonseigneur!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into\u000aa brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far\u000abehind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly\u000adiminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and\u000ahis chateau.\u000a\u000aThe sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as\u000athe rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group\u000aat the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid\u000aof the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his\u000aman like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they\u000acould bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled\u000ain little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more\u000astars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having\u000abeen extinguished.\u000a\u000aThe shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees,\u000awas upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged\u000afor the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door\u000aof his chateau was opened to him.\u000a\u000a\u201cMonsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, not yet.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIX. The Gorgon\u2019s Head\u000a\u000a\u000aIt was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,\u000awith a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of\u000astaircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony\u000abusiness altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and\u000astone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in\u000aall directions. As if the Gorgon\u2019s head had surveyed it, when it was\u000afinished, two centuries ago.\u000a\u000aUp the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau\u000apreceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness\u000ato elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile\u000aof stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the\u000aflambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great\u000adoor, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being\u000ain the open night-air. Other sound than the owl\u2019s voice there was none,\u000asave the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of\u000athose dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then\u000aheave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.\u000a\u000aThe great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a\u000ahall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase;\u000agrimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a\u000apeasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord\u000awas angry.\u000a\u000aAvoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night,\u000aMonsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up\u000athe staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him\u000ato his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two\u000aothers. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon\u000athe hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries\u000abefitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.\u000aThe fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to\u000abreak--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture;\u000abut, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old\u000apages in the history of France.\u000a\u000aA supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round\u000aroom, in one of the chateau\u2019s four extinguisher-topped towers. A small\u000alofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds\u000aclosed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of\u000ablack, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy nephew,\u201d said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; \u201cthey\u000asaid he was not arrived.\u201d\u000a\u000aNor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.\u000a\u000a\u201cAh! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the\u000atable as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his\u000asumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and\u000ahe had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his\u000alips, when he put it down.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he calmly asked, looking with attention at the\u000ahorizontal lines of black and stone colour.\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur? That?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOutside the blinds. Open the blinds.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was done.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMonseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are\u000ahere.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into\u000athe vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round\u000afor instructions.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood,\u201d said the imperturbable master. \u201cClose them again.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was\u000ahalf way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,\u000ahearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the\u000afront of the chateau.\u000a\u000a\u201cAsk who is arrived.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind\u000aMonseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance\u000arapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.\u000aHe had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.\u000a\u000aHe was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and\u000athere, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came.\u000aHe had been known in England as Charles Darnay.\u000a\u000aMonseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake\u000ahands.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou left Paris yesterday, sir?\u201d he said to Monseigneur, as he took his\u000aseat at table.\u000a\u000a\u201cYesterday. And you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI come direct.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom London?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have been a long time coming,\u201d said the Marquis, with a smile.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn the contrary; I come direct.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time\u000aintending the journey.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have been detained by\u201d--the nephew stopped a moment in his\u000aanswer--\u201cvarious business.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWithout doubt,\u201d said the polished uncle.\u000a\u000aSo long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.\u000aWhen coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,\u000alooking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a\u000afine mask, opened a conversation.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that\u000atook me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is\u000aa sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have\u000asustained me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot to death,\u201d said the uncle; \u201cit is not necessary to say, to death.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI doubt, sir,\u201d returned the nephew, \u201cwhether, if it had carried me to\u000athe utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight\u000alines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a\u000agraceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good\u000abreeding that it was not reassuring.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, sir,\u201d pursued the nephew, \u201cfor anything I know, you may have\u000aexpressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious\u000acircumstances that surrounded me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said the uncle, pleasantly.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, however that may be,\u201d resumed the nephew, glancing at him with\u000adeep distrust, \u201cI know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,\u000aand would know no scruple as to means.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy friend, I told you so,\u201d said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the\u000atwo marks. \u201cDo me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI recall it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThank you,\u201d said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.\u000a\u000aHis tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical\u000ainstrument.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn effect, sir,\u201d pursued the nephew, \u201cI believe it to be at once your\u000abad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in\u000aFrance here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not quite understand,\u201d returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.\u000a\u201cDare I ask you to explain?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not\u000abeen overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would\u000ahave sent me to some fortress indefinitely.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is possible,\u201d said the uncle, with great calmness. \u201cFor the honour\u000aof the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.\u000aPray excuse me!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before\u000ayesterday was, as usual, a cold one,\u201d observed the nephew.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would not say happily, my friend,\u201d returned the uncle, with refined\u000apoliteness; \u201cI would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for\u000aconsideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence\u000ayour destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for\u000ayourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,\u000aat a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle\u000aaids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that\u000amight so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest\u000aand importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted\u000a(comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such\u000athings is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right\u000aof life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such\u000adogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),\u000aone fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing\u000asome insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have\u000alost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the\u000aassertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as\u000ato say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very\u000abad!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;\u000aas elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still\u000acontaining himself, that great means of regeneration.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern\u000atime also,\u201d said the nephew, gloomily, \u201cthat I believe our name to be\u000amore detested than any name in France.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet us hope so,\u201d said the uncle. \u201cDetestation of the high is the\u000ainvoluntary homage of the low.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is not,\u201d pursued the nephew, in his former tone, \u201ca face I can\u000alook at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any\u000adeference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA compliment,\u201d said the Marquis, \u201cto the grandeur of the family,\u000amerited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.\u000aHah!\u201d And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly\u000acrossed his legs.\u000a\u000aBut, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes\u000athoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at\u000ahim sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,\u000aand dislike, than was comportable with its wearer\u2019s assumption of\u000aindifference.\u000a\u000a\u201cRepression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear\u000aand slavery, my friend,\u201d observed the Marquis, \u201cwill keep the dogs\u000aobedient to the whip, as long as this roof,\u201d looking up to it, \u201cshuts\u000aout the sky.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the\u000achateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as\u000athey too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to\u000ahim that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from\u000athe ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof\u000ahe vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new\u000away--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead\u000awas fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.\u000a\u000a\u201cMeanwhile,\u201d said the Marquis, \u201cI will preserve the honour and repose\u000aof the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we\u000aterminate our conference for the night?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA moment more.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAn hour, if you please.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSir,\u201d said the nephew, \u201cwe have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits\u000aof wrong.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_We_ have done wrong?\u201d repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,\u000aand delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account\u000ato both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father\u2019s time, we did\u000aa world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and\u000aour pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father\u2019s time,\u000awhen it is equally yours? Can I separate my father\u2019s twin-brother, joint\u000ainheritor, and next successor, from himself?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDeath has done that!\u201d said the Marquis.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd has left me,\u201d answered the nephew, \u201cbound to a system that is\u000afrightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to\u000aexecute the last request of my dear mother\u2019s lips, and obey the last\u000alook of my dear mother\u2019s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to\u000aredress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSeeking them from me, my nephew,\u201d said the Marquis, touching him on the\u000abreast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--\u201cyou\u000awill for ever seek them in vain, be assured.\u201d\u000a\u000aEvery fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was\u000acruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking\u000aquietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he\u000atouched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of\u000aa small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the\u000abody, and said,\u000a\u000a\u201cMy friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have\u000alived.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his\u000abox in his pocket.\u000a\u000a\u201cBetter to be a rational creature,\u201d he added then, after ringing a small\u000abell on the table, \u201cand accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,\u000aMonsieur Charles, I see.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis property and France are lost to me,\u201d said the nephew, sadly; \u201cI\u000arenounce them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAre they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It\u000ais scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed\u000ato me from you, to-morrow--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhich I have the vanity to hope is not probable.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c--or twenty years hence--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou do me too much honour,\u201d said the Marquis; \u201cstill, I prefer that\u000asupposition.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to\u000arelinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHah!\u201d said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,\u000aunder the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,\u000amismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,\u000aand suffering.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHah!\u201d said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better\u000aqualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the\u000aweight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave\u000ait and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in\u000aanother generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse\u000aon it, and on all this land.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd you?\u201d said the uncle. \u201cForgive my curiosity; do you, under your new\u000aphilosophy, graciously intend to live?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at\u000atheir backs, may have to do some day--work.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn England, for example?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The\u000afamily name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be\u000alighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The\u000aMarquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his\u000avalet.\u000a\u000a\u201cEngland is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have\u000aprospered there,\u201d he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew\u000awith a smile.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may\u000abe indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You\u000aknow a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith a daughter?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d said the Marquis. \u201cYou are fatigued. Good night!\u201d\u000a\u000aAs he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy\u000ain his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,\u000awhich struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same\u000atime, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin\u000astraight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that\u000alooked handsomely diabolic.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d repeated the Marquis. \u201cA Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So\u000acommences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face\u000aoutside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew\u000alooked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood night!\u201d said the uncle. \u201cI look to the pleasure of seeing you\u000aagain in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his\u000achamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,\u201d he\u000aadded to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his\u000avalet to his own bedroom.\u000a\u000aThe valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his\u000aloose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still\u000anight. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no\u000anoise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some\u000aenchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose\u000aperiodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just\u000acoming on.\u000a\u000aHe moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the\u000ascraps of the day\u2019s journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow\u000atoil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the\u000aprison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at\u000athe fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the\u000achain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,\u000athe little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the\u000atall man with his arms up, crying, \u201cDead!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am cool now,\u201d said Monsieur the Marquis, \u201cand may go to bed.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin\u000agauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence\u000awith a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.\u000a\u000aThe stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night\u000afor three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables\u000arattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with\u000avery little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to\u000athe owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures\u000ahardly ever to say what is set down for them.\u000a\u000aFor three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,\u000astared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,\u000adead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.\u000aThe burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass\u000awere undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might\u000ahave come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,\u000ataxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as\u000athe starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and\u000athe yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and\u000afreed.\u000a\u000aThe fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain\u000aat the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the\u000aminutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark\u000ahours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,\u000aand the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.\u000a\u000aLighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still\u000atrees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water\u000aof the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces\u000acrimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the\u000aweather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur\u000athe Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.\u000aAt this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open\u000amouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.\u000a\u000aNow, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement\u000awindows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth\u000ashivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely\u000alightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the\u000afountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men\u000aand women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows\u000aout, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church\u000aand at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter\u000aprayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its\u000afoot.\u000a\u000aThe chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and\u000asurely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been\u000areddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;\u000anow, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked\u000around over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at\u000adoorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs\u000apulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.\u000a\u000aAll these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the\u000areturn of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the\u000achateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried\u000afigures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and\u000aeverywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?\u000a\u000aWhat winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already\u000aat work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day\u2019s dinner (not\u000amuch to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow\u2019s while to\u000apeck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it\u000ato a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or\u000ano, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,\u000adown the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the\u000afountain.\u000a\u000aAll the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about\u000ain their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other\u000aemotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought\u000ain and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly\u000aon, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their\u000atrouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of\u000athe people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and\u000aall the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded\u000aon the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was\u000ahighly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated\u000ainto the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting\u000ahimself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend,\u000aand what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind\u000aa servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle\u000a(double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of\u000athe German ballad of Leonora?\u000a\u000aIt portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.\u000a\u000aThe Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added\u000athe one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited\u000athrough about two hundred years.\u000a\u000aIt lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine\u000amask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the\u000aheart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt\u000awas a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:\u000a\u000a\u201cDrive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aX. Two Promises\u000a\u000a\u000aMore months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles\u000aDarnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French\u000alanguage who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he\u000awould have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with\u000ayoung men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a\u000aliving tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for\u000aits stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in\u000asound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not\u000aat that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were\u000ato be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had\u000adropped out of Tellson\u2019s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a\u000atutor, whose attainments made the student\u2019s way unusually pleasant and\u000aprofitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his\u000awork besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became\u000aknown and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the\u000acircumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.\u000aSo, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.\u000a\u000aIn London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor\u000ato lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he\u000awould not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and\u000adid it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.\u000a\u000aA certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he\u000aread with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a\u000acontraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek\u000aand Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in\u000aLondon.\u000a\u000aNow, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days\u000awhen it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has\u000ainvariably gone one way--Charles Darnay\u2019s way--the way of the love of a\u000awoman.\u000a\u000aHe had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never\u000aheard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice;\u000ahe had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was\u000aconfronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for\u000ahim. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination\u000aat the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,\u000along, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the\u000amere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so\u000amuch as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.\u000a\u000aThat he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a\u000asummer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,\u000ahe turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity\u000aof opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer\u000aday, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.\u000a\u000aHe found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy\u000awhich had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated\u000atheir sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a\u000avery energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength\u000aof resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was\u000asometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the\u000aexercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been\u000afrequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.\u000a\u000aHe studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with\u000aease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at\u000asight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cCharles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your\u000areturn these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were\u000aboth here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,\u201d he answered,\u000aa little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. \u201cMiss\u000aManette--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs well,\u201d said the Doctor, as he stopped short, \u201cand your return will\u000adelight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will\u000asoon be home.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDoctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her\u000abeing from home, to beg to speak to you.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was a blank silence.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes?\u201d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \u201cBring your chair here,\u000aand speak on.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less\u000aeasy.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,\u201d\u000a so he at length began, \u201cfor some year and a half, that I hope the topic\u000aon which I am about to touch may not--\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was stayed by the Doctor\u2019s putting out his hand to stop him. When he\u000ahad kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:\u000a\u000a\u201cIs Lucie the topic?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me\u000ato hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor\u000aManette!\u201d he said deferentially.\u000a\u000aThere was another blank silence before her father rejoined:\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.\u201d\u000a\u000aHis constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it\u000aoriginated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles\u000aDarnay hesitated.\u000a\u000a\u201cShall I go on, sir?\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother blank.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, go on.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly\u000aI say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and\u000athe hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been\u000aladen. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,\u000adisinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love\u000aher. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the\u000aground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,\u000aand cried:\u000a\u000a\u201cNot that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!\u201d\u000a\u000aHis cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles\u000aDarnay\u2019s ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had\u000aextended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter\u000aso received it, and remained silent.\u000a\u000a\u201cI ask your pardon,\u201d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some\u000amoments. \u201cI do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or\u000araise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair\u000aovershadowed his face:\u000a\u000a\u201cHave you spoken to Lucie?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNor written?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNever.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is\u000ato be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks\u000ayou.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know,\u201d said Darnay, respectfully, \u201chow can I fail to know, Doctor\u000aManette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between\u000ayou and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so\u000abelonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it\u000acan have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and\u000achild. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled\u000awith the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there\u000ais, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy\u000aitself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is\u000anow devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present\u000ayears and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the\u000aearly days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if\u000ayou had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could\u000ahardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that\u000ain which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to\u000ayou, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your\u000aneck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her\u000aown age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,\u000aloves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I\u000ahave known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a\u000alittle quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.\u000a\u000a\u201cDear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you\u000awith this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as\u000along as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even\u000anow feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch\u000ayour history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.\u000aHeaven is my witness that I love her!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe it,\u201d answered her father, mournfully. \u201cI have thought so\u000abefore now. I believe it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, do not believe,\u201d said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice\u000astruck with a reproachful sound, \u201cthat if my fortune were so cast as\u000athat, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time\u000aput any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a\u000aword of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I\u000ashould know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at\u000aa remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my\u000aheart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not\u000anow touch this honoured hand.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe laid his own upon it as he spoke.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like\u000ayou, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like\u000ayou, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting\u000ain a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your\u000alife and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide\u000awith Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to\u000acome in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.\u201d\u000a\u000aHis touch still lingered on her father\u2019s hand. Answering the touch for a\u000amoment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of\u000ahis chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the\u000aconference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that\u000aoccasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank\u000ayou with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have\u000ayou any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNone. As yet, none.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once\u000aascertain that, with my knowledge?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I\u000amight (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you seek any guidance from me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it\u000ain your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you seek any promise from me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do seek that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well\u000aunderstand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her\u000ainnocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I\u000acould retain no place in it against her love for her father.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor\u2019s\u000afavour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason,\u000aDoctor Manette,\u201d said Darnay, modestly but firmly, \u201cI would not ask that\u000aword, to save my life.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as\u000awell as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and\u000adelicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one\u000arespect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her\u000aheart.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMay I ask, sir, if you think she is--\u201d As he hesitated, her father\u000asupplied the rest.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs sought by any other suitor?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is what I meant to say.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer father considered a little before he answered:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,\u000aoccasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOr both,\u201d said Darnay.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want\u000aa promise from me. Tell me what it is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own\u000apart, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will\u000abear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you\u000amay be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against\u000ame. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The\u000acondition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to\u000arequire, I will observe immediately.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI give the promise,\u201d said the Doctor, \u201cwithout any condition. I believe\u000ayour object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I\u000abelieve your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties\u000abetween me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me\u000athat you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.\u000aIf there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--\u201d\u000a\u000aThe young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as\u000athe Doctor spoke:\u000a\u000a\u201c--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,\u000anew or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility\u000athereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her\u000asake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me\u000athan wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange\u000ahis fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own\u000ahand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou said something to me,\u201d said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile.\u000a\u201cWhat was it you said to me?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a\u000acondition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:\u000a\u000a\u201cYour confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my\u000apart. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother\u2019s, is\u000anot, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and\u000awhy I am in England.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cStop!\u201d said the Doctor of Beauvais.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no\u000asecret from you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cStop!\u201d\u000a\u000aFor an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for\u000aanother instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay\u2019s lips.\u000a\u000a\u201cTell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie\u000ashould love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you\u000apromise?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWillingly.\u000a\u000a\u201cGive me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she\u000ashould not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and\u000adarker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for\u000aMiss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his\u000areading-chair empty.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy father!\u201d she called to him. \u201cFather dear!\u201d\u000a\u000aNothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his\u000abedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at\u000ahis door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her\u000ablood all chilled, \u201cWhat shall I do! What shall I do!\u201d\u000a\u000aHer uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at\u000ahis door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of\u000aher voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down\u000atogether for a long time.\u000a\u000aShe came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He\u000aslept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished\u000awork, were all as usual.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXI. A Companion Picture\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cSydney,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his\u000ajackal; \u201cmix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.\u201d\u000a\u000aSydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before,\u000aand the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making\u000aa grand clearance among Mr. Stryver\u2019s papers before the setting in\u000aof the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver\u000aarrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until\u000aNovember should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and\u000abring grist to the mill again.\u000a\u000aSydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much\u000aapplication. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him\u000athrough the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded\u000athe towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled\u000ahis turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at\u000aintervals for the last six hours.\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you mixing that other bowl of punch?\u201d said Stryver the portly, with\u000ahis hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on\u000ahis back.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather\u000asurprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as\u000ashrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_Do_ you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes. And not for money. What do you say now?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t feel disposed to say much. Who is she?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGuess.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo I know her?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGuess.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not going to guess, at five o\u2019clock in the morning, with my brains\u000afrying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess, you must ask\u000ame to dinner.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting\u000aposture. \u201cSydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,\u000abecause you are such an insensible dog.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd you,\u201d returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, \u201care such a\u000asensitive and poetical spirit--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCome!\u201d rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, \u201cthough I don\u2019t prefer\u000aany claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still\u000aI am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are a luckier, if you mean that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t mean that. I mean I am a man of more--more--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSay gallantry, while you are about it,\u201d suggested Carton.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell! I\u2019ll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,\u201d said Stryver,\u000ainflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, \u201cwho cares more to\u000abe agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how\u000ato be agreeable, in a woman\u2019s society, than you do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGo on,\u201d said Sydney Carton.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo; but before I go on,\u201d said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying\u000away, \u201cI\u2019ll have this out with you. You\u2019ve been at Doctor Manette\u2019s house\u000aas much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your\u000amoroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and\u000ahangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you,\u000aSydney!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to\u000abe ashamed of anything,\u201d returned Sydney; \u201cyou ought to be much obliged\u000ato me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou shall not get off in that way,\u201d rejoined Stryver, shouldering the\u000arejoinder at him; \u201cno, Sydney, it\u2019s my duty to tell you--and I tell you\u000ato your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned\u000afellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.\u201d\u000a\u000aSydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.\u000a\u000a\u201cLook at me!\u201d said Stryver, squaring himself; \u201cI have less need to make\u000amyself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.\u000aWhy do I do it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never saw you do it yet,\u201d muttered Carton.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do it because it\u2019s politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I\u000aget on.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,\u201d\u000a answered Carton, with a careless air; \u201cI wish you would keep to that. As\u000ato me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe asked the question with some appearance of scorn.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have no business to be incorrigible,\u201d was his friend\u2019s answer,\u000adelivered in no very soothing tone.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have no business to be, at all, that I know of,\u201d said Sydney Carton.\u000a\u201cWho is the lady?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, don\u2019t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable,\u000aSydney,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness\u000afor the disclosure he was about to make, \u201cbecause I know you don\u2019t mean\u000ahalf you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I\u000amake this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to\u000ame in slighting terms.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI did?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCertainly; and in these chambers.\u201d\u000a\u000aSydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend;\u000adrank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young\u000alady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or\u000adelicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a\u000alittle resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.\u000aYou want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I\u000athink of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man\u2019s opinion of\u000aa picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music\u000aof mine, who had no ear for music.\u201d\u000a\u000aSydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,\u000alooking at his friend.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow you know all about it, Syd,\u201d said Mr. Stryver. \u201cI don\u2019t care about\u000afortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to\u000aplease myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She\u000awill have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,\u000aand a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her,\u000abut she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?\u201d\u000a\u000aCarton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, \u201cWhy should I be\u000aastonished?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou approve?\u201d\u000a\u000aCarton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, \u201cWhy should I not approve?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell!\u201d said his friend Stryver, \u201cyou take it more easily than I fancied\u000ayou would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would\u000abe; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your\u000aancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had\u000aenough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I\u000afeel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels\u000ainclined to go to it (when he doesn\u2019t, he can stay away), and I feel\u000athat Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me\u000acredit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to\u000asay a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you\u000aknow; you really are in a bad way. You don\u2019t know the value of money,\u000ayou live hard, you\u2019ll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor;\u000ayou really ought to think about a nurse.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as\u000abig as he was, and four times as offensive.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, let me recommend you,\u201d pursued Stryver, \u201cto look it in the face.\u000aI have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face,\u000ayou, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of\u000ayou. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women\u2019s society, nor\u000aunderstanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some\u000arespectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way,\u000aor lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day. That\u2019s the\u000akind of thing for _you_. Now think of it, Sydney.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ll think of it,\u201d said Sydney.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXII. The Fellow of Delicacy\u000a\u000a\u000aMr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good\u000afortune on the Doctor\u2019s daughter, resolved to make her happiness known\u000ato her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental\u000adebating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as\u000awell to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange\u000aat their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two\u000abefore Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it\u000aand Hilary.\u000a\u000aAs to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly\u000asaw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly\u000agrounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a\u000aplain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the\u000aplaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for\u000athe defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to\u000aconsider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer\u000acase could be.\u000a\u000aAccordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal\u000aproposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to\u000aRanelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present\u000ahimself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.\u000a\u000aTowards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple,\u000awhile the bloom of the Long Vacation\u2019s infancy was still upon it.\u000aAnybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet\u000aon Saint Dunstan\u2019s side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way\u000aalong the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have\u000aseen how safe and strong he was.\u000a\u000aHis way taking him past Tellson\u2019s, and he both banking at Tellson\u2019s and\u000aknowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.\u000aStryver\u2019s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness\u000aof the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle\u000ain its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient\u000acashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.\u000aLorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron\u000abars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything\u000aunder the clouds were a sum.\u000a\u000a\u201cHalloa!\u201d said Mr. Stryver. \u201cHow do you do? I hope you are well!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was Stryver\u2019s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any\u000aplace, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson\u2019s, that old clerks\u000ain distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he\u000asqueezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading\u000athe paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if\u000athe Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.\u000a\u000aThe discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would\u000arecommend under the circumstances, \u201cHow do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do\u000ayou do, sir?\u201d and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner\u000aof shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson\u2019s who shook\u000ahands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a\u000aself-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.\u000a\u000a\u201cCan I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry, in his\u000abusiness character.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I\u000ahave come for a private word.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh indeed!\u201d said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed\u000ato the House afar off.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am going,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the\u000adesk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to\u000abe not half desk enough for him: \u201cI am going to make an offer of myself\u000ain marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh dear me!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his\u000avisitor dubiously.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh dear me, sir?\u201d repeated Stryver, drawing back. \u201cOh dear you, sir?\u000aWhat may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy meaning,\u201d answered the man of business, \u201cis, of course, friendly and\u000aappreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,\u000amy meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.\u000aStryver--\u201d Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest\u000amanner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,\u000a\u201cyou know there really is so much too much of you!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell!\u201d said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,\u000aopening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, \u201cif I understand you,\u000aMr. Lorry, I\u2019ll be hanged!\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that\u000aend, and bit the feather of a pen.\u000a\u000a\u201cD--n it all, sir!\u201d said Stryver, staring at him, \u201cam I not eligible?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you\u2019re eligible!\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cIf you say\u000aeligible, you are eligible.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAm I not prosperous?\u201d asked Stryver.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,\u201d said Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd advancing?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you come to advancing you know,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be\u000aable to make another admission, \u201cnobody can doubt that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?\u201d demanded Stryver,\u000aperceptibly crestfallen.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell! I--Were you going there now?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cStraight!\u201d said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen I think I wouldn\u2019t, if I was you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy?\u201d said Stryver. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll put you in a corner,\u201d forensically\u000ashaking a forefinger at him. \u201cYou are a man of business and bound to\u000ahave a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn\u2019t you go?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBecause,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go on such an object without\u000ahaving some cause to believe that I should succeed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cD--n _me_!\u201d cried Stryver, \u201cbut this beats everything.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry\u000aStryver.\u000a\u000a\u201cHere\u2019s a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_\u000aa Bank,\u201d said Stryver; \u201cand having summed up three leading reasons for\u000acomplete success, he says there\u2019s no reason at all! Says it with his\u000ahead on!\u201d Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have\u000abeen infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and\u000awhen I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of\u000acauses and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young\u000alady, my good sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, \u201cthe\u000ayoung lady. The young lady goes before all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Stryver, squaring his\u000aelbows, \u201cthat it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at\u000apresent in question is a mincing Fool?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,\u201d said Mr. Lorry,\u000areddening, \u201cthat I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady\u000afrom any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose\u000ataste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could\u000anot restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at\u000athis desk, not even Tellson\u2019s should prevent my giving him a piece of my\u000amind.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver\u2019s\u000ablood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;\u000aMr. Lorry\u2019s veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in\u000ano better state now it was his turn.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is what I mean to tell you, sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cPray let there\u000abe no mistake about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood\u000ahitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the\u000atoothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not\u000ato go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King\u2019s Bench\u000abar?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVery good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd all I can say of it is,\u201d laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, \u201cthat\u000athis--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow understand me,\u201d pursued Mr. Lorry. \u201cAs a man of business, I am\u000anot justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of\u000abusiness, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried\u000aMiss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and\u000aof her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have\u000aspoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I\u000amay not be right?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot I!\u201d said Stryver, whistling. \u201cI can\u2019t undertake to find third\u000aparties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense\u000ain certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It\u2019s\u000anew to me, but you are right, I dare say.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And\u000aunderstand me, sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, \u201cI\u000awill not--not even at Tellson\u2019s--have it characterised for me by any\u000agentleman breathing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere! I beg your pardon!\u201d said Stryver.\u000a\u000a\u201cGranted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be\u000apainful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor\u000aManette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very\u000apainful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You\u000aknow the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with\u000athe family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you\u000ain no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a\u000alittle new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon\u000ait. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its\u000asoundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied\u000awith it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is\u000abest spared. What do you say?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow long would you keep me in town?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the\u000aevening, and come to your chambers afterwards.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen I say yes,\u201d said Stryver: \u201cI won\u2019t go up there now, I am not so\u000ahot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look\u000ain to-night. Good morning.\u201d\u000a\u000aThen Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a\u000aconcussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it\u000abowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength\u000aof the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were\u000aalways seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly\u000abelieved, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in\u000athe empty office until they bowed another customer in.\u000a\u000aThe barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have\u000agone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than\u000amoral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to\u000aswallow, he got it down. \u201cAnd now,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, shaking his\u000aforensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, \u201cmy way\u000aout of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found\u000agreat relief. \u201cYou shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,\u201d said Mr.\u000aStryver; \u201cI\u2019ll do that for you.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o\u2019clock,\u000aMr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the\u000apurpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of\u000athe morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was\u000aaltogether in an absent and preoccupied state.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell!\u201d said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of\u000abootless attempts to bring him round to the question. \u201cI have been to\u000aSoho.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo Soho?\u201d repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. \u201cOh, to be sure! What am I\u000athinking of!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I have no doubt,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cthat I was right in the\u000aconversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my\u000aadvice.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI assure you,\u201d returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, \u201cthat I\u000aam sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father\u2019s\u000aaccount. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let\u000aus say no more about it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d said Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cI dare say not,\u201d rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and\u000afinal way; \u201cno matter, no matter.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut it does matter,\u201d Mr. Lorry urged.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo it doesn\u2019t; I assure you it doesn\u2019t. Having supposed that there was\u000asense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is\u000anot a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is\u000adone. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have\u000arepented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish\u000aaspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been\u000aa bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am\u000aglad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing\u000afor me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could\u000ahave gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not\u000aproposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means\u000acertain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to\u000athat extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and\u000agiddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you\u000awill always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,\u000aI regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.\u000aAnd I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,\u000aand for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do;\u000ayou were right, it never would have done.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.\u000aStryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of\u000ashowering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.\u000a\u201cMake the best of it, my dear sir,\u201d said Stryver; \u201csay no more about it;\u000athank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stryver\u000awas lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy\u000a\u000a\u000aIf Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the\u000ahouse of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,\u000aand had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he\u000acared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,\u000awhich overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely\u000apierced by the light within him.\u000a\u000aAnd yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,\u000aand for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night\u000ahe vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no\u000atransitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary\u000afigure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams\u000aof the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture\u000ain spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time\u000abrought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,\u000ainto his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known\u000ahim more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon\u000ait no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that\u000aneighbourhood.\u000a\u000aOn a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal\u000athat \u201che had thought better of that marrying matter\u201d) had carried his\u000adelicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the\u000aCity streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health\u000afor the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney\u2019s feet still trod\u000athose stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became\u000aanimated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,\u000athey took him to the Doctor\u2019s door.\u000a\u000aHe was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had\u000anever been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little\u000aembarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at\u000ahis face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed\u000aa change in it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What\u000ais to be expected of, or by, such profligates?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to\u000alive no better life?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGod knows it is a shame!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen why not change it?\u201d\u000a\u000aLooking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that\u000athere were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he\u000aanswered:\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall\u000asink lower, and be worse.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The\u000atable trembled in the silence that followed.\u000a\u000aShe had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to\u000abe so, without looking at her, and said:\u000a\u000a\u201cPray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of\u000awhat I want to say to you. Will you hear me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,\u000ait would make me very glad!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGod bless you for your sweet compassion!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to hear me. Don\u2019t shrink from anything I say. I am like\u000aone who died young. All my life might have been.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am\u000asure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSay of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the\u000amystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget\u000ait!\u201d\u000a\u000aShe was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed despair\u000aof himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have\u000abeen holden.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the\u000alove of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken,\u000apoor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been\u000aconscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would\u000abring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you,\u000adisgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have\u000ano tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot\u000abe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWithout it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall\u000ayou--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your\u000aconfidence? I know this is a confidence,\u201d she modestly said, after a\u000alittle hesitation, and in earnest tears, \u201cI know you would say this to\u000ano one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe shook his head.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very\u000alittle more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that\u000ayou have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not\u000abeen so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this\u000ahome made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had\u000adied out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that\u000aI thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from\u000aold voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I\u000ahave had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off\u000asloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all\u000aa dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down,\u000abut I wish you to know that you inspired it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWill nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite\u000aundeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the\u000aweakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,\u000aheap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in\u000aits nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no\u000aservice, idly burning away.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSince it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy\u000athan you were before you knew me--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if\u000aanything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSince the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,\u000aattributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can\u000amake it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for\u000agood, with you, at all?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come\u000ahere to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life,\u000athe remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;\u000aand that there was something left in me at this time which you could\u000adeplore and pity.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhich I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with\u000aall my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEntreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself,\u000aand I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let\u000ame believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life\u000awas reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there\u000aalone, and will be shared by no one?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf that will be a consolation to you, yes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Carton,\u201d she answered, after an agitated pause, \u201cthe secret is\u000ayours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThank you. And again, God bless you.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.\u000a\u000a\u201cBe under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this\u000aconversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it\u000aagain. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In\u000athe hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and\u000ashall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made\u000ato you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried\u000ain your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so\u000asad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept\u000adown and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he\u000astood looking back at her.\u000a\u000a\u201cBe comforted!\u201d he said, \u201cI am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An\u000ahour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn\u000abut yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any\u000awretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I\u000ashall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be\u000awhat you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make\u000ato you, is, that you will believe this of me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will, Mr. Carton.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve\u000ayou of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and\u000abetween whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say\u000ait, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to\u000ayou, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that\u000athere was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would\u000aembrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold\u000ame in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one\u000athing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new\u000aties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly\u000aand strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever\u000agrace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a\u000ahappy father\u2019s face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright\u000abeauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is\u000aa man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said, \u201cFarewell!\u201d said a last \u201cGod bless you!\u201d and left her.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXIV. The Honest Tradesman\u000a\u000a\u000aTo the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in\u000aFleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and\u000avariety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit\u000aupon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and\u000anot be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending\u000awestward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,\u000aboth ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where\u000athe sun goes down!\u000a\u000aWith his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,\u000alike the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty\u000awatching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever\u000arunning dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,\u000asince a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid\u000awomen (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from\u000aTellson\u2019s side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such\u000acompanionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed\u000ato become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to\u000ahave the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from\u000athe gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent\u000apurpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.\u000a\u000aTime was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in\u000athe sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,\u000abut not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.\u000a\u000aIt fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were\u000afew, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so\u000aunprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.\u000aCruncher must have been \u201cflopping\u201d in some pointed manner, when an\u000aunusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his\u000aattention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of\u000afuneral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this\u000afuneral, which engendered uproar.\u000a\u000a\u201cYoung Jerry,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, \u201cit\u2019s a\u000aburyin\u2019.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHooroar, father!\u201d cried Young Jerry.\u000a\u000aThe young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious\u000asignificance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched\u000ahis opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat d\u2019ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey\u000ato your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for\u000a_me_!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. \u201cHim and his hooroars! Don\u2019t\u000alet me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D\u2019ye\u000ahear?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI warn\u2019t doing no harm,\u201d Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.\u000a\u000a\u201cDrop it then,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher; \u201cI won\u2019t have none of _your_ no\u000aharms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.\u201d\u000a\u000aHis son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing\u000around a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach\u000athere was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were\u000aconsidered essential to the dignity of the position. The position\u000aappeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble\u000asurrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and\u000aincessantly groaning and calling out: \u201cYah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!\u201d\u000a with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.\u000a\u000aFunerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he\u000aalways pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed\u000aTellson\u2019s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance\u000aexcited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is it, brother? What\u2019s it about?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_I_ don\u2019t know,\u201d said the man. \u201cSpies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe asked another man. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_I_ don\u2019t know,\u201d returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth\u000anevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the\u000agreatest ardour, \u201cSpies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!\u201d\u000a\u000aAt length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled\u000aagainst him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the\u000afuneral of one Roger Cly.\u000a\u000a\u201cWas He a spy?\u201d asked Mr. Cruncher.\u000a\u000a\u201cOld Bailey spy,\u201d returned his informant. \u201cYaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey\u000aSpi--i--ies!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, to be sure!\u201d exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had\u000aassisted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him. Dead, is he?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDead as mutton,\u201d returned the other, \u201cand can\u2019t be too dead. Have \u2018em\u000aout, there! Spies! Pull \u2018em out, there! Spies!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,\u000athat the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the\u000asuggestion to have \u2018em out, and to pull \u2018em out, mobbed the two vehicles\u000aso closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd\u2019s opening the coach\u000adoors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands\u000afor a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,\u000athat in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after\u000ashedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and\u000aother symbolical tears.\u000a\u000aThese, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great\u000aenjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a\u000acrowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.\u000aThey had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin\u000aout, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to\u000aits destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being\u000amuch needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and\u000athe coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,\u000awhile as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any\u000aexercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers\u000awas Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from\u000athe observation of Tellson\u2019s, in the further corner of the mourning\u000acoach.\u000a\u000aThe officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in\u000athe ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices\u000aremarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory\u000amembers of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.\u000aThe remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the\u000ahearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under\u000aclose inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended\u000aby his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a\u000apopular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional\u000aornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his\u000abear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to\u000athat part of the procession in which he walked.\u000a\u000aThus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite\u000acaricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting\u000aat every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination\u000awas the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there\u000ain course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,\u000aaccomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and\u000ahighly to its own satisfaction.\u000a\u000aThe dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of\u000aproviding some other entertainment for itself, another brighter\u000agenius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual\u000apassers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase\u000awas given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near\u000athe Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and\u000athey were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of\u000awindow-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy\u000aand natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had\u000abeen pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm\u000athe more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were\u000acoming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps\u000athe Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual\u000aprogress of a mob.\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained\u000abehind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.\u000aThe place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a\u000aneighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and\u000amaturely considering the spot.\u000a\u000a\u201cJerry,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,\u000a\u201cyou see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he\u000awas a young \u2018un and a straight made \u2018un.\u201d\u000a\u000aHaving smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned\u000ahimself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his\u000astation at Tellson\u2019s. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched\u000ahis liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all\u000aamiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent\u000aman, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon\u000ahis medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.\u000a\u000aYoung Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No\u000ajob in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the\u000ausual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, I tell you where it is!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on\u000aentering. \u201cIf, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I\u000ashall make sure that you\u2019ve been praying again me, and I shall work you\u000afor it just the same as if I seen you do it.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, you\u2019re at it afore my face!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of\u000aangry apprehension.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am saying nothing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, then; don\u2019t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.\u000aYou may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, Jerry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, Jerry,\u201d repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. \u201cAh! It _is_\u000ayes, Jerry. That\u2019s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,\u000abut made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general\u000aironical dissatisfaction.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou and your yes, Jerry,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his\u000abread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible\u000aoyster out of his saucer. \u201cAh! I think so. I believe you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are going out to-night?\u201d asked his decent wife, when he took\u000aanother bite.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, I am.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMay I go with you, father?\u201d asked his son, briskly.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, you mayn\u2019t. I\u2019m a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That\u2019s\u000awhere I\u2019m going to. Going a fishing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don\u2019t it, father?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNever you mind.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShall you bring any fish home, father?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I don\u2019t, you\u2019ll have short commons, to-morrow,\u201d returned that\u000agentleman, shaking his head; \u201cthat\u2019s questions enough for you; I ain\u2019t a\u000agoing out, till you\u2019ve been long abed.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a\u000amost vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in\u000aconversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions\u000ato his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in\u000aconversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling\u000aon any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than\u000ahe would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest\u000aperson could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an\u000ahonest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a\u000aprofessed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd mind you!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher. \u201cNo games to-morrow! If I, as a\u000ahonest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none\u000aof your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest\u000atradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring\u000aon water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly\u000acustomer to you, if you don\u2019t. _I_\u2018m your Rome, you know.\u201d\u000a\u000aThen he began grumbling again:\u000a\u000a\u201cWith your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don\u2019t\u000aknow how scarce you mayn\u2019t make the wittles and drink here, by your\u000aflopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_\u000ayour\u2019n, ain\u2019t he? He\u2019s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,\u000aand not know that a mother\u2019s first duty is to blow her boy out?\u201d\u000a\u000aThis touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to\u000aperform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above\u000aall things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal\u000afunction so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.\u000a\u000aThus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry\u000awas ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,\u000aobeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with\u000asolitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one\u000ao\u2019clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,\u000atook a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought\u000aforth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other\u000afishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him\u000ain skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,\u000aextinguished the light, and went out.\u000a\u000aYoung Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to\u000abed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he\u000afollowed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the\u000acourt, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning\u000ahis getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the\u000adoor stood ajar all night.\u000a\u000aImpelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his\u000afather\u2019s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,\u000awalls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his\u000ahonoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not\u000agone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and\u000athe two trudged on together.\u000a\u000aWithin half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the\u000awinking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a\u000alonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,\u000athat if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the\u000asecond follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split\u000ahimself into two.\u000a\u000aThe three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped\u000aunder a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low\u000abrick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and\u000awall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which\u000athe wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.\u000aCrouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that\u000aYoung Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well\u000adefined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.\u000aHe was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the\u000athird. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay\u000athere a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands\u000aand knees.\u000a\u000aIt was now Young Jerry\u2019s turn to approach the gate: which he did,\u000aholding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking\u000ain, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!\u000aand all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard\u000athat they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church\u000atower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not\u000acreep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to\u000afish.\u000a\u000aThey fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent\u000aappeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.\u000aWhatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful\u000astriking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,\u000awith his hair as stiff as his father\u2019s.\u000a\u000aBut, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not\u000aonly stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They\u000awere still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for\u000athe second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a\u000ascrewing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were\u000astrained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the\u000aearth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what\u000ait would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to\u000awrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he\u000amade off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.\u000a\u000aHe would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,\u000ait being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable\u000ato get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen\u000awas running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt\u000aupright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him\u000aand hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to\u000ashun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it\u000awas making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the\u000aroadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them\u000alike a dropsical boy\u2019s Kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways\u000atoo, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up\u000ato its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,\u000aand lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was\u000aincessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy\u000agot to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then\u000ait would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every\u000astair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on\u000ahis breast when he fell asleep.\u000a\u000aFrom his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after\u000adaybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the\u000afamily room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry\u000ainferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the\u000aears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the\u000abed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI told you I would,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, \u201cand I did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJerry, Jerry, Jerry!\u201d his wife implored.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou oppose yourself to the profit of the business,\u201d said Jerry, \u201cand me\u000aand my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don\u2019t\u000ayou?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI try to be a good wife, Jerry,\u201d the poor woman protested, with tears.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it being a good wife to oppose your husband\u2019s business? Is it\u000ahonouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your\u000ahusband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou hadn\u2019t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s enough for you,\u201d retorted Mr. Cruncher, \u201cto be the wife of a\u000ahonest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations\u000awhen he took to his trade or when he didn\u2019t. A honouring and obeying\u000awife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious\u000awoman? If you\u2019re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have\u000ano more nat\u2019ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has\u000aof a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in\u000athe honest tradesman\u2019s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down\u000aat his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on\u000ahis back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay\u000adown too, and fell asleep again.\u000a\u000aThere was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.\u000aCruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid\u000aby him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case\u000ahe should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed\u000aand washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his\u000aostensible calling.\u000a\u000aYoung Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father\u2019s side\u000aalong sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry\u000afrom him of the previous night, running home through darkness and\u000asolitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,\u000aand his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not\u000aimprobable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,\u000athat fine morning.\u000a\u000a\u201cFather,\u201d said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep\u000aat arm\u2019s length and to have the stool well between them: \u201cwhat\u2019s a\u000aResurrection-Man?\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, \u201cHow\u000ashould I know?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought you knowed everything, father,\u201d said the artless boy.\u000a\u000a\u201cHem! Well,\u201d returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his\u000ahat to give his spikes free play, \u201che\u2019s a tradesman.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s his goods, father?\u201d asked the brisk Young Jerry.\u000a\u000a\u201cHis goods,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, \u201cis a\u000abranch of Scientific goods.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPersons\u2019 bodies, ain\u2019t it, father?\u201d asked the lively boy.\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe it is something of that sort,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I\u2019m quite\u000agrowed up!\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.\u000a\u201cIt depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop\u000ayour talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and\u000athere\u2019s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit\u000afor.\u201d As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,\u000ato plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to\u000ahimself: \u201cJerry, you honest tradesman, there\u2019s hopes wot that boy will\u000ayet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXV. Knitting\u000a\u000a\u000aThere had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur\u000aDefarge. As early as six o\u2019clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping\u000athrough its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over\u000ameasures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best\u000aof times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that\u000ahe sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its\u000ainfluence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No\u000avivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur\u000aDefarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in\u000athe dregs of it.\u000a\u000aThis had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been\u000aearly drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun\u000aon Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early\u000abrooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and\u000aslunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could\u000anot have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These\u000awere to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could\u000ahave commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,\u000aand from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy\u000alooks.\u000a\u000aNotwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop\u000awas not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the\u000athreshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see\u000aonly Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of\u000awine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced\u000aand beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of\u000ahumanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.\u000a\u000aA suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps\u000aobserved by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in\u000aat every place, high and low, from the king\u2019s palace to the criminal\u2019s\u000agaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built\u000atowers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops\u000aof wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve\u000awith her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible\u000aa long way off.\u000a\u000aThus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was\u000ahigh noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under\u000ahis swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a\u000amender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered\u000athe wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast\u000aof Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and\u000aflickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had\u000afollowed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though\u000athe eyes of every man there were turned upon them.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood day, gentlemen!\u201d said Monsieur Defarge.\u000a\u000aIt may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited\u000aan answering chorus of \u201cGood day!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is bad weather, gentlemen,\u201d said Defarge, shaking his head.\u000a\u000aUpon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down\u000atheir eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy wife,\u201d said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: \u201cI have\u000atravelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called\u000aJacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half\u2019s journey out of Paris.\u000aHe is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to\u000adrink, my wife!\u201d\u000a\u000aA second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the\u000amender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,\u000aand drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark\u000abread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near\u000aMadame Defarge\u2019s counter. A third man got up and went out.\u000a\u000aDefarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less\u000athan was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no\u000ararity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.\u000aHe looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even\u000aMadame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.\u000a\u000a\u201cHave you finished your repast, friend?\u201d he asked, in due season.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCome, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could\u000aoccupy. It will suit you to a marvel.\u201d\u000a\u000aOut of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a\u000acourtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the\u000astaircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man\u000asat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.\u000a\u000aNo white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had\u000agone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired\u000aman afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at\u000ahim through the chinks in the wall.\u000a\u000aDefarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:\u000a\u000a\u201cJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness\u000aencountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.\u000aSpeak, Jacques Five!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with\u000ait, and said, \u201cWhere shall I commence, monsieur?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCommence,\u201d was Monsieur Defarge\u2019s not unreasonable reply, \u201cat the\u000acommencement.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI saw him then, messieurs,\u201d began the mender of roads, \u201ca year ago this\u000arunning summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the\u000achain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun\u000agoing to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he\u000ahanging by the chain--like this.\u201d\u000a\u000aAgain the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which\u000ahe ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been\u000athe infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village\u000aduring a whole year.\u000a\u000aJacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?\u000a\u000a\u201cNever,\u201d answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.\u000a\u000aJacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?\u000a\u000a\u201cBy his tall figure,\u201d said the mender of roads, softly, and with his\u000afinger at his nose. \u201cWhen Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,\u000a\u2018Say, what is he like?\u2019 I make response, \u2018Tall as a spectre.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou should have said, short as a dwarf,\u201d returned Jacques Two.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he\u000aconfide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not\u000aoffer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger,\u000astanding near our little fountain, and says, \u2018To me! Bring that rascal!\u2019\u000aMy faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is right there, Jacques,\u201d murmured Defarge, to him who had\u000ainterrupted. \u201cGo on!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood!\u201d said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. \u201cThe tall man\u000ais lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo matter, the number,\u201d said Defarge. \u201cHe is well hidden, but at last\u000ahe is unluckily found. Go on!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to\u000ago to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the\u000avillage below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see\u000acoming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man\u000awith his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!\u201d\u000a\u000aWith the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his\u000aelbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.\u000a\u000a\u201cI stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers\u000aand their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any\u000aspectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I\u000asee no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and\u000athat they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun\u000agoing to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that\u000atheir long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the\u000aroad, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.\u000aAlso, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves\u000awith them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near\u000ato me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would\u000abe well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as\u000aon the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it\u000avividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not\u000ashow the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with\u000aour eyes. \u2018Come on!\u2019 says the chief of that company, pointing to the\u000avillage, \u2018bring him fast to his tomb!\u2019 and they bring him faster. I\u000afollow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden\u000ashoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and\u000aconsequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe imitated the action of a man\u2019s being impelled forward by the\u000abutt-ends of muskets.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They\u000alaugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust,\u000abut he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into\u000athe village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill,\u000aand up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the\u000adarkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding\u000asnap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by\u000aopening it again, Defarge said, \u201cGo on, Jacques.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAll the village,\u201d pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low\u000avoice, \u201cwithdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the\u000avillage sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the\u000alocks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,\u000aexcept to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating\u000amy morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on\u000amy way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty\u000airon cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no\u000ahand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a\u000adead man.\u201d\u000a\u000aDefarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all\u000aof them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the\u000acountryman\u2019s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was\u000aauthoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One\u000aand Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on\u000ahis hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally\u000aintent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding\u000aover the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge\u000astanding between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the\u000alight of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to\u000ahim.\u000a\u000a\u201cGo on, Jacques,\u201d said Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks\u000aat him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a\u000adistance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work\u000aof the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all\u000afaces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards\u000athe posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They\u000awhisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be\u000aexecuted; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing\u000athat he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say\u000athat a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?\u000aIt is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cListen then, Jacques,\u201d Number One of that name sternly interposed.\u000a\u201cKnow that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,\u000ayourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,\u000asitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the\u000ahazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in\u000ahis hand.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd once again listen, Jacques!\u201d said the kneeling Number Three:\u000ahis fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a\u000astrikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither\u000afood nor drink; \u201cthe guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,\u000aand struck him blows. You hear?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hear, messieurs.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGo on then,\u201d said Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cAgain; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,\u201d resumed the\u000acountryman, \u201cthat he is brought down into our country to be executed on\u000athe spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper\u000athat because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the\u000afather of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a\u000aparricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed\u000awith the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds\u000awhich will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be\u000apoured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,\u000athat he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man\u000asays, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on\u000athe life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?\u000aI am not a scholar.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cListen once again then, Jacques!\u201d said the man with the restless hand\u000aand the craving air. \u201cThe name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was\u000aall done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and\u000anothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than\u000athe crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager\u000aattention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,\u000awhen he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was\u000adone--why, how old are you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThirty-five,\u201d said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen\u000ait.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEnough!\u201d said Defarge, with grim impatience. \u201cLong live the Devil! Go\u000aon.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;\u000aeven the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday\u000anight when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from\u000athe prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.\u000aWorkmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by\u000athe fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the\u000awater.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,\u000aand pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,\u000athe cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers\u000ahave marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst\u000aof many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is\u000aa gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he\u000alaughed.\u201d He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,\u000afrom the corners of his mouth to his ears. \u201cOn the top of the gallows is\u000afixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged\u000athere forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,\u000aon which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the\u000aspectacle.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw\u000awater! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have\u000aI said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to\u000abed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,\u000aacross the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,\u000amessieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other\u000athree, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),\u000aand I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was\u000awarned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now\u000awalking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here\u000ayou see me!\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, \u201cGood! You have acted\u000aand recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the\u000adoor?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVery willingly,\u201d said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the\u000atop of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.\u000a\u000aThe three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to\u000athe garret.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow say you, Jacques?\u201d demanded Number One. \u201cTo be registered?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo be registered, as doomed to destruction,\u201d returned Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cMagnificent!\u201d croaked the man with the craving.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe chateau, and all the race?\u201d inquired the first.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe chateau and all the race,\u201d returned Defarge. \u201cExtermination.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, \u201cMagnificent!\u201d and began\u000agnawing another finger.\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you sure,\u201d asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, \u201cthat no embarrassment\u000acan arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is\u000asafe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always\u000abe able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJacques,\u201d returned Defarge, drawing himself up, \u201cif madame my wife\u000aundertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose\u000aa word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her\u000aown symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in\u000aMadame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,\u000ato erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or\u000acrimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who\u000ahungered, asked: \u201cIs this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is\u000avery simple; is he not a little dangerous?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe knows nothing,\u201d said Defarge; \u201cat least nothing more than would\u000aeasily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself\u000awith him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him\u000aon his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and\u000aCourt; let him see them on Sunday.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat?\u201d exclaimed the hungry man, staring. \u201cIs it a good sign, that he\u000awishes to see Royalty and Nobility?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJacques,\u201d said Defarge; \u201cjudiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her\u000ato thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish\u000ahim to bring it down one day.\u201d\u000a\u000aNothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already\u000adozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the\u000apallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon\u000aasleep.\u000a\u000aWorse quarters than Defarge\u2019s wine-shop, could easily have been found\u000ain Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious\u000adread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very\u000anew and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly\u000aunconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that\u000ahis being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that\u000ahe shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he\u000acontended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady\u000amight pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it\u000ainto her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a\u000amurder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through\u000awith it until the play was played out.\u000a\u000aTherefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted\u000a(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur\u000aand himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have\u000amadame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was\u000aadditionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the\u000aafternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to\u000asee the carriage of the King and Queen.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou work hard, madame,\u201d said a man near her.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d answered Madame Defarge; \u201cI have a good deal to do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you make, madame?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMany things.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor instance--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor instance,\u201d returned Madame Defarge, composedly, \u201cshrouds.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender\u000aof roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close\u000aand oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was\u000afortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King\u000aand the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the\u000ashining Bull\u2019s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing\u000aladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour\u000aand elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both\u000asexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary\u000aintoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,\u000aLong live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of\u000aubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,\u000aterraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull\u2019s Eye,\u000amore lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept\u000awith sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three\u000ahours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,\u000aand throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him\u000afrom flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to\u000apieces.\u000a\u000a\u201cBravo!\u201d said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a\u000apatron; \u201cyou are a good boy!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of\u000ahaving made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are the fellow we want,\u201d said Defarge, in his ear; \u201cyou make\u000athese fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more\u000ainsolent, and it is the nearer ended.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHey!\u201d cried the mender of roads, reflectively; \u201cthat\u2019s true.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThese fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would\u000astop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than\u000ain one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath\u000atells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot\u000adeceive them too much.\u201d\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in\u000aconfirmation.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs to you,\u201d said she, \u201cyou would shout and shed tears for anything, if\u000ait made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTruly, madame, I think so. For the moment.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to\u000apluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would\u000apick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTruly yes, madame.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were\u000aset upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,\u000ayou would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is true, madame.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have seen both dolls and birds to-day,\u201d said Madame Defarge, with\u000aa wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;\u000a\u201cnow, go home!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXVI. Still Knitting\u000a\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the\u000abosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the\u000adarkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by\u000athe wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where\u000athe chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to\u000athe whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,\u000afor listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village\u000ascarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead\u000astick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and\u000aterrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that\u000athe expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the\u000avillage--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that\u000awhen the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to\u000afaces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled\u000aup forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel\u000alook of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the\u000astone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder\u000awas done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which\u000aeverybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the\u000ascarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the\u000acrowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a\u000askinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all\u000astarted away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares\u000awho could find a living there.\u000a\u000aChateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the\u000astone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres\u000aof land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the\u000anight sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole\u000aworld, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling\u000astar. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse\u000athe manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in\u000athe feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every\u000avice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.\u000a\u000aThe Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,\u000ain their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their\u000ajourney naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier\u000aguardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual\u000aexamination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two\u000aof the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate\u000awith, and affectionately embraced.\u000a\u000aWhen Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings,\u000aand they, having finally alighted near the Saint\u2019s boundaries, were\u000apicking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his\u000astreets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:\u000a\u000a\u201cSay then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cVery little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy\u000acommissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he\u000acan say, but he knows of one.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEh well!\u201d said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool\u000abusiness air. \u201cIt is necessary to register him. How do they call that\u000aman?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is English.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo much the better. His name?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBarsad,\u201d said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had\u000abeen so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect\u000acorrectness.\u000a\u000a\u201cBarsad,\u201d repeated madame. \u201cGood. Christian name?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJohn.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJohn Barsad,\u201d repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.\u000a\u201cGood. His appearance; is it known?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAge, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;\u000acomplexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face\u000athin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a\u000apeculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,\u000asinister.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEh my faith. It is a portrait!\u201d said madame, laughing. \u201cHe shall be\u000aregistered to-morrow.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),\u000aand where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted\u000athe small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the\u000astock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of\u000aher own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally\u000adismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the bowl\u000aof money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her\u000ahandkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the\u000anight. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked\u000aup and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which\u000acondition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he\u000awalked up and down through life.\u000a\u000aThe night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a\u000aneighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge\u2019s olfactory sense was\u000aby no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than\u000ait ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He\u000awhiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are fatigued,\u201d said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the\u000amoney. \u201cThere are only the usual odours.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am a little tired,\u201d her husband acknowledged.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are a little depressed, too,\u201d said madame, whose quick eyes had\u000anever been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for\u000ahim. \u201cOh, the men, the men!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut my dear!\u201d began Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut my dear!\u201d repeated madame, nodding firmly; \u201cbut my dear! You are\u000afaint of heart to-night, my dear!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, then,\u201d said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his\u000abreast, \u201cit _is_ a long time.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a long time,\u201d repeated his wife; \u201cand when is it not a long time?\u000aVengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,\u201d said\u000aDefarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow long,\u201d demanded madame, composedly, \u201cdoes it take to make and store\u000athe lightning? Tell me.\u201d\u000a\u000aDefarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that\u000atoo.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt does not take a long time,\u201d said madame, \u201cfor an earthquake to\u000aswallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the\u000aearthquake?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA long time, I suppose,\u201d said Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything\u000abefore it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not\u000aseen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.\u000a\u000a\u201cI tell thee,\u201d said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,\u000a\u201cthat although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and\u000acoming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it\u000ais always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world\u000athat we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider\u000athe rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with\u000amore and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock\u000ayou.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy brave wife,\u201d returned Defarge, standing before her with his head\u000aa little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and\u000aattentive pupil before his catechist, \u201cI do not question all this. But\u000ait has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,\u000ait is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEh well! How then?\u201d demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there\u000awere another enemy strangled.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell!\u201d said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.\u000a\u201cWe shall not see the triumph.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe shall have helped it,\u201d returned madame, with her extended hand in\u000astrong action. \u201cNothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all\u000amy soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew\u000acertainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I\u000awould--\u201d\u000a\u000aThen madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.\u000a\u000a\u201cHold!\u201d cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with\u000acowardice; \u201cI too, my dear, will stop at nothing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim\u000aand your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that.\u000aWhen the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the\u000atime with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.\u201d\u000a\u000aMadame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her\u000alittle counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains\u000aout, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene\u000amanner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.\u000a\u000aNext noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the\u000awine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she\u000anow and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her\u000ausual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not\u000adrinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,\u000aand heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous\u000aperquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell\u000adead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies\u000aout promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they\u000athemselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met\u000athe same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they\u000athought as much at Court that sunny summer day.\u000a\u000aA figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she\u000afelt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her\u000arose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.\u000a\u000aIt was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the\u000acustomers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the\u000awine-shop.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood day, madame,\u201d said the new-comer.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood day, monsieur.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:\u000a\u201cHah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black\u000ahair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,\u000athin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a\u000apeculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister\u000aexpression! Good day, one and all!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a\u000amouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d\u000a\u000aMadame complied with a polite air.\u000a\u000a\u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame\u000aDefarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,\u000ahowever, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The\u000avisitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity\u000aof observing the place in general.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile.\u000a\u000a\u201cDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPastime,\u201d said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her\u000afingers moved nimbly.\u000a\u000a\u201cNot for use?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\u201d said\u000amadame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of\u000acoquetry, \u201cI\u2019ll use it!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be\u000adecidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two\u000amen had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,\u000acatching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of\u000alooking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.\u000aNor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there\u000aone left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open,\u000abut had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a\u000apoverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and\u000aunimpeachable.\u000a\u000a\u201c_John_,\u201d thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted,\u000aand her eyes looked at the stranger. \u201cStay long enough, and I shall knit\u000a\u2018BARSAD\u2019 before you go.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have a husband, madame?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cChildren?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo children.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBusiness seems bad?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBusiness is very bad; the people are so poor.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs _you_ say,\u201d madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an\u000aextra something into his name that boded him no good.\u000a\u000a\u201cPardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.\u000aOf course.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c_I_ think?\u201d returned madame, in a high voice. \u201cI and my husband have\u000aenough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we\u000athink, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and\u000ait gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without\u000aembarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did\u000anot allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,\u000astood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame\u000aDefarge\u2019s little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.\u000a\u000a\u201cA bad business this, madame, of Gaspard\u2019s execution. Ah! the poor\u000aGaspard!\u201d With a sigh of great compassion.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy faith!\u201d returned madame, coolly and lightly, \u201cif people use knives\u000afor such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the\u000aprice of his luxury was; he has paid the price.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe,\u201d said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone\u000athat invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary\u000asusceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: \u201cI believe there\u000ais much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor\u000afellow? Between ourselves.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs there?\u201d asked madame, vacantly.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs there not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c--Here is my husband!\u201d said Madame Defarge.\u000a\u000aAs the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted\u000ahim by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, \u201cGood day,\u000aJacques!\u201d Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood day, Jacques!\u201d the spy repeated; with not quite so much\u000aconfidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou deceive yourself, monsieur,\u201d returned the keeper of the wine-shop.\u000a\u201cYou mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is all the same,\u201d said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: \u201cgood\u000aday!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood day!\u201d answered Defarge, drily.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when\u000ayou entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy\u000aand anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo one has told me so,\u201d said Defarge, shaking his head. \u201cI know nothing\u000aof it.\u201d\u000a\u000aHaving said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his\u000ahand on the back of his wife\u2019s chair, looking over that barrier at the\u000aperson to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would\u000ahave shot with the greatest satisfaction.\u000a\u000aThe spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious\u000aattitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh\u000awater, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it\u000aout for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over\u000ait.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?\u201d\u000a observed Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cNot at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested\u000ain its miserable inhabitants.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHah!\u201d muttered Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,\u201d\u000a pursued the spy, \u201cthat I have the honour of cherishing some interesting\u000aassociations with your name.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed!\u201d said Defarge, with much indifference.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,\u000ahad the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am\u000ainformed of the circumstances?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSuch is the fact, certainly,\u201d said Defarge. He had had it conveyed\u000ato him, in an accidental touch of his wife\u2019s elbow as she knitted and\u000awarbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was to you,\u201d said the spy, \u201cthat his daughter came; and it was\u000afrom your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown\u000amonsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of\u000aTellson and Company--over to England.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSuch is the fact,\u201d repeated Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cVery interesting remembrances!\u201d said the spy. \u201cI have known Doctor\u000aManette and his daughter, in England.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes?\u201d said Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t hear much about them now?\u201d said the spy.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d said Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn effect,\u201d madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little\u000asong, \u201cwe never hear about them. We received the news of their safe\u000aarrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,\u000athey have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held\u000ano correspondence.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerfectly so, madame,\u201d replied the spy. \u201cShe is going to be married.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGoing?\u201d echoed madame. \u201cShe was pretty enough to have been married long\u000aago. You English are cold, it seems to me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! You know I am English.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI perceive your tongue is,\u201d returned madame; \u201cand what the tongue is, I\u000asuppose the man is.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best\u000aof it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the\u000aend, he added:\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to\u000aone who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah,\u000apoor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is\u000agoing to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard\u000awas exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present\u000aMarquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is\u000aMr. Charles Darnay. D\u2019Aulnais is the name of his mother\u2019s family.\u201d\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable\u000aeffect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,\u000aas to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was\u000atroubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no\u000aspy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.\u000a\u000aHaving made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be\u000aworth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad\u000apaid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,\u000ain a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the\u000apleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes\u000aafter he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the\u000ahusband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should\u000acome back.\u000a\u000a\u201cCan it be true,\u201d said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife\u000aas he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: \u201cwhat he has\u000asaid of Ma\u2019amselle Manette?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs he has said it,\u201d returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, \u201cit\u000ais probably false. But it may be true.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it is--\u201d Defarge began, and stopped.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it is?\u201d repeated his wife.\u000a\u000a\u201c--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her\u000asake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHer husband\u2019s destiny,\u201d said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure,\u000a\u201cwill take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is\u000ato end him. That is all I know.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange\u201d--said\u000aDefarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,\u000a\u201cthat, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her\u000ahusband\u2019s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by\u000athe side of that infernal dog\u2019s who has just left us?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cStranger things than that will happen when it does come,\u201d answered\u000amadame. \u201cI have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here\u000afor their merits; that is enough.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently\u000atook the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.\u000aEither Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable\u000adecoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its\u000adisappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very\u000ashortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.\u000a\u000aIn the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned\u000ahimself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came\u000ato the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame\u000aDefarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place\u000ato place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like\u000aher--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women\u000aknitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a\u000amechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the\u000ajaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still,\u000athe stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.\u000a\u000aBut, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as Madame\u000aDefarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer\u000aamong every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left\u000abehind.\u000a\u000aHer husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration. \u201cA\u000agreat woman,\u201d said he, \u201ca strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully\u000agrand woman!\u201d\u000a\u000aDarkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and\u000athe distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as\u000athe women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another\u000adarkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing\u000apleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into\u000athundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a\u000awretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty,\u000aFreedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women who sat\u000aknitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around\u000aa structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,\u000acounting dropping heads.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXVII. One Night\u000a\u000a\u000aNever did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in\u000aSoho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat\u000aunder the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder\u000aradiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still\u000aseated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.\u000a\u000aLucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last evening\u000afor her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are happy, my dear father?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cQuite, my child.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it\u000awas yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself\u000ain her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in\u000aboth ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this\u000atime was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the\u000alove that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles\u2019s love\u000afor me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or\u000aif my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by\u000athe length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and\u000aself-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is--\u201d\u000a\u000aEven as it was, she could not command her voice.\u000a\u000aIn the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face\u000aupon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of\u000athe sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and\u000aits going.\u000a\u000a\u201cDearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,\u000aquite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will\u000aever interpose between us? _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your\u000aown heart, do you feel quite certain?\u201d\u000a\u000aHer father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could\u000ascarcely have assumed, \u201cQuite sure, my darling! More than that,\u201d he\u000aadded, as he tenderly kissed her: \u201cmy future is far brighter, Lucie,\u000aseen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever\u000awas--without it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I could hope _that_, my father!--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBelieve it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain\u000ait is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot\u000afully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be\u000awasted--\u201d\u000a\u000aShe moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated\u000athe word.\u000a\u000a\u201c--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the\u000anatural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely\u000acomprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself,\u000ahow could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy\u000awith you.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy\u000awithout Charles, having seen him; and replied:\u000a\u000a\u201cMy child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been\u000aCharles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I\u000ashould have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have\u000acast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him\u000arefer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new\u000asensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long\u000aafterwards.\u000a\u000a\u201cSee!\u201d said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon.\u000a\u201cI have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her\u000alight. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think\u000aof her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against\u000amy prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,\u000athat I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I\u000acould draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines\u000awith which I could intersect them.\u201d He added in his inward and pondering\u000amanner, as he looked at the moon, \u201cIt was twenty either way, I remember,\u000aand the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,\u000adeepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in\u000athe manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present\u000acheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn\u000achild from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had\u000abeen born alive, or the poor mother\u2019s shock had killed it. Whether it\u000awas a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my\u000aimprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it\u000awas a son who would never know his father\u2019s story; who might even live\u000ato weigh the possibility of his father\u2019s having disappeared of his own\u000awill and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of\u000ame--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have\u000acast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married\u000ato a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from\u000athe remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a\u000ablank.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who\u000anever existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have\u000abrought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and\u000athe moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence\u000ahave touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as\u000alike a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its\u000afoundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and\u000aleading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her\u000aimage in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held\u000aher in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.\u000aBut, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of\u000asight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another\u000aand more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than\u000athat she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you\u000ahave--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?\u000aI doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these\u000aperplexed distinctions.\u201d\u000a\u000aHis collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running\u000acold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,\u000acoming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married\u000alife was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture\u000awas in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,\u000acheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love\u000athat was I.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd she showed me her children,\u201d said the Doctor of Beauvais, \u201cand\u000athey had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed\u000aa prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked\u000aup at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I\u000aimagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.\u000aBut then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and\u000ablessed her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless\u000ame as fervently to-morrow?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night\u000afor loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great\u000ahappiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the\u000ahappiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked\u000aHeaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they went into the\u000ahouse.\u000a\u000aThere was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to\u000abe no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no\u000achange in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,\u000aby taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the\u000aapocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.\u000a\u000aDoctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only\u000athree at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles\u000awas not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving\u000alittle plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.\u000a\u000aSo, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.\u000aBut, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came\u000adownstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,\u000abeforehand.\u000a\u000aAll things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay\u000aasleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his\u000ahands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the\u000ashadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;\u000athen, leaned over him, and looked at him.\u000a\u000aInto his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he\u000acovered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the\u000amastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet,\u000aresolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be\u000abeheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.\u000a\u000aShe timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that\u000ashe might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his\u000asorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once\u000amore, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves\u000aof the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved\u000ain praying for him.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXVIII. Nine Days\u000a\u000a\u000aThe marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the\u000aclosed door of the Doctor\u2019s room, where he was speaking with Charles\u000aDarnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr.\u000aLorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of\u000areconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,\u000abut for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should\u000ahave been the bridegroom.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd so,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,\u000aand who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,\u000apretty dress; \u201cand so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought\u000ayou across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought\u000awhat I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring\u000aon my friend Mr. Charles!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, \u201cand\u000atherefore how could you know it? Nonsense!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cReally? Well; but don\u2019t cry,\u201d said the gentle Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not crying,\u201d said Miss Pross; \u201c_you_ are.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI, my Pross?\u201d (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her,\u000aon occasion.)\u000a\u000a\u201cYou were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don\u2019t wonder at it. Such\u000aa present of plate as you have made \u2018em, is enough to bring tears into\u000aanybody\u2019s eyes. There\u2019s not a fork or a spoon in the collection,\u201d said\u000aMiss Pross, \u201cthat I didn\u2019t cry over, last night after the box came, till\u000aI couldn\u2019t see it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am highly gratified,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cthough, upon my honour, I\u000ahad no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance\u000ainvisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man\u000aspeculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there\u000amight have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot at all!\u201d From Miss Pross.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?\u201d asked the\u000agentleman of that name.\u000a\u000a\u201cPooh!\u201d rejoined Miss Pross; \u201cyou were a bachelor in your cradle.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell!\u201d observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, \u201cthat\u000aseems probable, too.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd you were cut out for a bachelor,\u201d pursued Miss Pross, \u201cbefore you\u000awere put in your cradle.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen, I think,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cthat I was very unhandsomely dealt\u000awith, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my\u000apattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,\u201d drawing his arm soothingly round\u000aher waist, \u201cI hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and\u000aI, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final\u000aopportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave\u000ayour good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your\u000aown; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next\u000afortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson\u2019s\u000ashall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at\u000athe fortnight\u2019s end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on\u000ayour other fortnight\u2019s trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent\u000ahim to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear\u000aSomebody\u2019s step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an\u000aold-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his\u000aown.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the\u000awell-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright\u000agolden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and\u000adelicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.\u000a\u000aThe door of the Doctor\u2019s room opened, and he came out with Charles\u000aDarnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they\u000awent in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.\u000aBut, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the\u000ashrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the\u000aold air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold\u000awind.\u000a\u000aHe gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot\u000awhich Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in\u000aanother carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange\u000aeyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.\u000a\u000aBesides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little\u000agroup when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,\u000aglanced on the bride\u2019s hand, which were newly released from the\u000adark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry\u2019s pockets. They returned home to\u000abreakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had\u000amingled with the poor shoemaker\u2019s white locks in the Paris garret, were\u000amingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the\u000adoor at parting.\u000a\u000aIt was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father\u000acheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her\u000aenfolding arms, \u201cTake her, Charles! She is yours!\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was\u000agone.\u000a\u000aThe corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the\u000apreparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,\u000aand Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into\u000athe welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great\u000achange to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted\u000athere, had struck him a poisoned blow.\u000a\u000aHe had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been\u000aexpected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was\u000athe old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent\u000amanner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own\u000aroom when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the\u000awine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think,\u201d he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, \u201cI\u000athink we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.\u000aI must look in at Tellson\u2019s; so I will go there at once and come back\u000apresently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine\u000athere, and all will be well.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson\u2019s, than to look out of\u000aTellson\u2019s. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the\u000aold staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus\u000ainto the Doctor\u2019s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood God!\u201d he said, with a start. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. \u201cO me, O me! All is\u000alost!\u201d cried she, wringing her hands. \u201cWhat is to be told to Ladybird?\u000aHe doesn\u2019t know me, and is making shoes!\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the\u000aDoctor\u2019s room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been\u000awhen he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent\u000adown, and he was very busy.\u000a\u000a\u201cDoctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he\u000awere angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.\u000a\u000aHe had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the\u000athroat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old\u000ahaggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked\u000ahard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a\u000ashoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by\u000ahim, and asked what it was.\u000a\u000a\u201cA young lady\u2019s walking shoe,\u201d he muttered, without looking up. \u201cIt\u000aought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, Doctor Manette. Look at me!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in\u000ahis work.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper\u000aoccupation. Think, dear friend!\u201d\u000a\u000aNothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at\u000aa time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract\u000aa word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and\u000awords fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on\u000athe air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that\u000ahe sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there\u000aseemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were\u000atrying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.\u000a\u000aTwo things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above\u000aall others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;\u000athe second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In\u000aconjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter\u000aprecaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a\u000afew days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised\u000aon his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been\u000acalled away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of\u000atwo or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been\u000aaddressed to her by the same post.\u000a\u000aThese measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in\u000athe hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept\u000aanother course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he\u000athought the best, on the Doctor\u2019s case.\u000a\u000aIn the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course\u000abeing thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him\u000aattentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He\u000atherefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson\u2019s for the\u000afirst time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same\u000aroom.\u000a\u000aHe was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak\u000ato him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that\u000aattempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always\u000abefore him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had\u000afallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the\u000awindow, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and\u000anatural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.\u000a\u000aDoctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,\u000athat first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour\u000aafter Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.\u000aWhen he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose\u000aand said to him:\u000a\u000a\u201cWill you go out?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,\u000alooked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:\u000a\u000a\u201cOut?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; for a walk with me. Why not?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.\u000aLorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,\u000awith his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in\u000asome misty way asking himself, \u201cWhy not?\u201d The sagacity of the man of\u000abusiness perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.\u000a\u000aMiss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him\u000aat intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long\u000atime before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he\u000afell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his\u000abench and to work.\u000a\u000aOn this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,\u000aand spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He\u000areturned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and\u000athat he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry\u000ato have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;\u000aat those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then\u000apresent, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing\u000aamiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long\u000aenough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry\u2019s\u000afriendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he\u000aappeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding\u000ahim.\u000a\u000aWhen it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:\u000a\u000a\u201cDear Doctor, will you go out?\u201d\u000a\u000aAs before, he repeated, \u201cOut?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; for a walk with me. Why not?\u201d\u000a\u000aThis time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer\u000afrom him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the\u000ameanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had\u000asat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry\u2019s return, he\u000aslipped away to his bench.\u000a\u000aThe time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry\u2019s hope darkened, and his\u000aheart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.\u000aThe third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,\u000aseven days, eight days, nine days.\u000a\u000aWith a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and\u000aheavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was\u000awell kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to\u000aobserve that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,\u000awas growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on\u000ahis work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in\u000athe dusk of the ninth evening.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXIX. An Opinion\u000a\u000a\u000aWorn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the\u000atenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun\u000ainto the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark\u000anight.\u000a\u000aHe rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\u000adone so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the\u000aDoctor\u2019s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker\u2019s bench\u000aand tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading\u000aat the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\u000aMr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\u000astudious and attentive.\u000a\u000aEven when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\u000agiddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\u000anot be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\u000afriend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\u000aas usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\u000awhich he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\u000a\u000aIt was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\u000aanswer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\u000acorresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\u000aHow came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\u000aManette\u2019s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\u000aDoctor\u2019s bedroom door in the early morning?\u000a\u000aWithin a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he\u000ahad had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\u000aresolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\u000aHe advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\u000abreakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual\u000ahad occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.\u000aLorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\u000athe opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\u000a\u000aMiss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\u000aout with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical\u000atoilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\u000awhite linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the\u000ausual way, and came to breakfast.\u000a\u000aSo far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\u000adelicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe\u000aadvance, he at first supposed that his daughter\u2019s marriage had taken\u000aplace yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\u000athe day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\u000acounting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\u000ahe was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid\u000ahe sought. And that aid was his own.\u000a\u000aTherefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the\u000aDoctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a\u000avery curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is\u000avery curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less\u000aso.\u201d\u000a\u000aGlancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\u000aDoctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced\u000aat his hands more than once.\u000a\u000a\u201cDoctor Manette,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the\u000aarm, \u201cthe case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\u000agive your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,\u000afor his daughter\u2019s--his daughter\u2019s, my dear Manette.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I understand,\u201d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, \u201csome mental\u000ashock--?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBe explicit,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cSpare no detail.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,\u000aof great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\u000athe--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a\u000ashock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\u000along, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\u000aare no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from\u000awhich the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\u000ahimself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is\u000athe case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to\u000abe a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\u000agreat exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\u000astock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,\u000athere has been,\u201d he paused and took a deep breath--\u201ca slight relapse.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Doctor, in a low voice, asked, \u201cOf how long duration?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNine days and nights.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow did it show itself? I infer,\u201d glancing at his hands again, \u201cin the\u000aresumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is the fact.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, did you ever see him,\u201d asked the Doctor, distinctly and\u000acollectedly, though in the same low voice, \u201cengaged in that pursuit\u000aoriginally?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOnce.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all\u000arespects--as he was then?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think in all respects.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.\u000aIt is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, \u201cThat was very kind. That was\u000avery thoughtful!\u201d Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of\u000athe two spoke for a little while.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, my dear Manette,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most\u000aconsiderate and most affectionate way, \u201cI am a mere man of business,\u000aand unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not\u000apossess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of\u000aintelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom\u000aI could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this\u000arelapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it\u000abe prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come\u000aabout at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been\u000amore desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,\u000aif I knew how.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,\u000aknowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be\u000aable to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.\u000aPray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,\u000aand teach me how to be a little more useful.\u201d\u000a\u000aDoctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and\u000aMr. Lorry did not press him.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it probable,\u201d said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,\u000a\u201cthat the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite\u000aunforeseen by its subject.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWas it dreaded by him?\u201d Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.\u000a\u000a\u201cVery much.\u201d He said it with an involuntary shudder.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer\u2019s\u000amind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force\u000ahimself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWould he,\u201d asked Mr. Lorry, \u201cbe sensibly relieved if he could prevail\u000aupon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on\u000ahim?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even\u000abelieve it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor\u2019s arm again,\u000aafter a short silence on both sides, \u201cto what would you refer this\u000aattack?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe,\u201d returned Doctor Manette, \u201cthat there had been a strong and\u000aextraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that\u000awas the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most\u000adistressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that\u000athere had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations\u000awould be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a\u000aparticular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the\u000aeffort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWould he remember what took place in the relapse?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry,\u000awith natural hesitation.\u000a\u000aThe Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and\u000aanswered, in a low voice, \u201cNot at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, as to the future,\u201d hinted Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs to the future,\u201d said the Doctor, recovering firmness, \u201cI should have\u000agreat hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I\u000ashould have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated\u000asomething, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,\u000aand recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that\u000athe worst was over.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, well! That\u2019s good comfort. I am thankful!\u201d said Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am thankful!\u201d repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are two other points,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201con which I am anxious to\u000abe instructed. I may go on?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou cannot do your friend a better service.\u201d The Doctor gave him his\u000ahand.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;\u000ahe applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional\u000aknowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does\u000ahe do too much?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in\u000asingular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in\u000apart, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy\u000athings, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy\u000adirection. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are sure that he is not under too great a strain?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think I am quite sure of it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Manette, if he were overworked now--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a\u000aviolent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cExcuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment,\u000athat he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this\u000adisorder?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not think so. I do not think,\u201d said Doctor Manette with the\u000afirmness of self-conviction, \u201cthat anything but the one train of\u000aassociation would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some\u000aextraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has\u000ahappened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any\u000asuch violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost\u000abelieve, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing\u000awould overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the\u000aconfidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal\u000aendurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that\u000aconfidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he\u000areally was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to\u000abe the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning\u000aconversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the\u000alast nine days, he knew that he must face it.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction\u000aso happily recovered from,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, \u201cwe\u000awill call--Blacksmith\u2019s work, Blacksmith\u2019s work. We will say, to put a\u000acase and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad\u000atime, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly\u000afound at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by\u000ahim?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot\u000anervously on the ground.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe has always kept it by him,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at\u000ahis friend. \u201cNow, would it not be better that he should let it go?\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the\u000aground.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou do not find it easy to advise me?\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cI quite\u000aunderstand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--\u201d And there he\u000ashook his head, and stopped.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou see,\u201d said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,\u000a\u201cit is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings\u000aof this poor man\u2019s mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that\u000aoccupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved\u000ahis pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for\u000athe perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more\u000apractised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental\u000atorture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it\u000aquite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of\u000ahimself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind\u000aof confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not\u000afind it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may\u000afancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry\u2019s\u000aface.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business\u000awho only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and\u000abank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of\u000athe idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go\u000awith it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the\u000aforge?\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was another silence.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou see, too,\u201d said the Doctor, tremulously, \u201cit is such an old\u000acompanion.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI would not keep it,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained\u000ain firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. \u201cI would recommend him to\u000asacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good.\u000aCome! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his daughter\u2019s\u000asake, my dear Manette!\u201d\u000a\u000aVery strange to see what a struggle there was within him!\u000a\u000a\u201cIn her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take\u000ait away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not there;\u000alet him miss his old companion after an absence.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They\u000apassed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the\u000athree following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth\u000aday he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution that\u000ahad been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously\u000aexplained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and\u000ashe had no suspicions.\u000a\u000aOn the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into\u000ahis room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross\u000acarrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and\u000aguilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker\u2019s bench to pieces, while\u000aMiss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for\u000awhich, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The\u000aburning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the\u000apurpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,\u000ashoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do destruction\u000aand secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross,\u000awhile engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its\u000atraces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible\u000acrime.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXX. A Plea\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to\u000aoffer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at home\u000amany hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or\u000ain looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity\u000aabout him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.\u000a\u000aHe watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of\u000aspeaking to him when no one overheard.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Darnay,\u201d said Carton, \u201cI wish we might be friends.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are already friends, I hope.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don\u2019t\u000amean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be\u000afriends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.\u201d\u000a\u000aCharles Darnay--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and\u000agood-fellowship, what he did mean?\u000a\u000a\u201cUpon my life,\u201d said Carton, smiling, \u201cI find that easier to comprehend\u000ain my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me try. You\u000aremember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than\u000ausual?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that\u000ayou had been drinking.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I\u000aalways remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one day,\u000awhen all days are at an end for me! Don\u2019t be alarmed; I am not going to\u000apreach.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming\u000ato me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh!\u201d said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that\u000aaway. \u201cOn the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as\u000ayou know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I\u000awish you would forget it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI forgot it long ago.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to\u000ame, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it,\u000aand a light answer does not help me to forget it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it was a light answer,\u201d returned Darnay, \u201cI beg your forgiveness\u000afor it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my\u000asurprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on the\u000afaith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good\u000aHeaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important to\u000aremember, in the great service you rendered me that day?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs to the great service,\u201d said Carton, \u201cI am bound to avow to you, when\u000ayou speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I\u000adon\u2019t know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind! I\u000asay when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou make light of the obligation,\u201d returned Darnay, \u201cbut I will not\u000aquarrel with _your_ light answer.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGenuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my purpose;\u000aI was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me; you know I am\u000aincapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If you doubt it,\u000aask Stryver, and he\u2019ll tell you so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done\u000aany good, and never will.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know that you \u2018never will.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could endure\u000ato have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent\u000areputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be\u000apermitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might\u000abe regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the\u000aresemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of\u000afurniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I\u000adoubt if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I\u000ashould avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I\u000adare say, to know that I had it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWill you try?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have\u000aindicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your name?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think so, Carton, by this time.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute\u000aafterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.\u000a\u000aWhen he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss\u000aPross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of\u000athis conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a\u000aproblem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not\u000abitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw\u000ahim as he showed himself.\u000a\u000aHe had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young\u000awife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found\u000aher waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly\u000amarked.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are thoughtful to-night!\u201d said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, dearest Charles,\u201d with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring\u000aand attentive expression fixed upon him; \u201cwe are rather thoughtful\u000ato-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is it, my Lucie?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWill you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to\u000aask it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWill I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the\u000acheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!\u000a\u000a\u201cI think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and\u000arespect than you expressed for him to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed, my own? Why so?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he does.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very\u000alenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that\u000ahe has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep\u000awounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a painful reflection to me,\u201d said Charles Darnay, quite\u000aastounded, \u201cthat I should have done him any wrong. I never thought this\u000aof him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is\u000ascarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable\u000anow. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things,\u000aeven magnanimous things.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man,\u000athat her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd, O my dearest Love!\u201d she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her\u000ahead upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, \u201cremember how strong\u000awe are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe supplication touched him home. \u201cI will always remember it, dear\u000aHeart! I will remember it as long as I live.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded\u000aher in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets,\u000acould have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops\u000aof pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of\u000athat husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not\u000ahave parted from his lips for the first time--\u000a\u000a\u201cGod bless her for her sweet compassion!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXXI. Echoing Footsteps\u000a\u000a\u000aA wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where\u000athe Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound\u000aher husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and\u000acompanion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in\u000athe tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of\u000ayears.\u000a\u000aAt first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,\u000awhen her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be\u000adimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,\u000aafar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.\u000aFluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:\u000adoubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided\u000aher breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of\u000afootsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would\u000abe left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her\u000aeyes, and broke like waves.\u000a\u000aThat time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among the\u000aadvancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of\u000aher prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young\u000amother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and\u000athe shady house was sunny with a child\u2019s laugh, and the Divine friend of\u000achildren, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take\u000aher child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred\u000ajoy to her.\u000a\u000aEver busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,\u000aweaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all\u000atheir lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the\u000aechoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband\u2019s\u000astep was strong and prosperous among them; her father\u2019s firm and equal.\u000aLo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an\u000aunruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the\u000aplane-tree in the garden!\u000a\u000aEven when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not\u000aharsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a\u000apillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant\u000asmile, \u201cDear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to\u000aleave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!\u201d those were not\u000atears all of agony that wetted his young mother\u2019s cheek, as the spirit\u000adeparted from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and\u000aforbid them not. They see my Father\u2019s face. O Father, blessed words!\u000a\u000aThus, the rustling of an Angel\u2019s wings got blended with the other\u000aechoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath\u000aof Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were\u000amingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed\u000amurmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as\u000athe little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or\u000adressing a doll at her mother\u2019s footstool, chattered in the tongues of\u000athe Two Cities that were blended in her life.\u000a\u000aThe Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some\u000ahalf-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in\u000auninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once\u000adone often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing\u000aregarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by\u000aall true echoes for ages and ages.\u000a\u000aNo man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a\u000ablameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother,\u000abut her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive\u000adelicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in\u000asuch a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton\u000awas the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms,\u000aand he kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of\u000ahim, almost at the last. \u201cPoor Carton! Kiss him for me!\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine\u000aforcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in\u000ahis wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually\u000ain a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped\u000alife of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and\u000astronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made\u000ait the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his\u000astate of lion\u2019s jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of\u000arising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with\u000aproperty and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them\u000abut the straight hair of their dumpling heads.\u000a\u000aThese three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most\u000aoffensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three\u000asheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to\u000aLucie\u2019s husband: delicately saying \u201cHalloa! here are three lumps of\u000abread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!\u201d The polite\u000arejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.\u000aStryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the\u000atraining of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the\u000apride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of\u000adeclaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts\u000aMrs. Darnay had once put in practice to \u201ccatch\u201d him, and on the\u000adiamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him \u201cnot\u000ato be caught.\u201d Some of his King\u2019s Bench familiars, who were occasionally\u000aparties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the\u000alatter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed\u000ait himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an\u000aoriginally bad offence, as to justify any such offender\u2019s being carried\u000aoff to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.\u000a\u000aThese were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes\u000aamused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little\u000adaughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her\u000achild\u2019s tread came, and those of her own dear father\u2019s, always active\u000aand self-possessed, and those of her dear husband\u2019s, need not be told.\u000aNor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself\u000awith such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any\u000awaste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet\u000ain her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her\u000amore devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the\u000amany times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed\u000ato divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her \u201cWhat is\u000athe magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us,\u000aas if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to\u000ahave too much to do?\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly\u000ain the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about\u000alittle Lucie\u2019s sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound,\u000aas of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.\u000a\u000aOn a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.\u000aLorry came in late, from Tellson\u2019s, and sat himself down by Lucie and\u000aher husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were\u000aall three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the\u000alightning from the same place.\u000a\u000a\u201cI began to think,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, \u201cthat\u000aI should have to pass the night at Tellson\u2019s. We have been so full of\u000abusiness all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way\u000ato turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a\u000arun of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able\u000ato confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania\u000aamong some of them for sending it to England.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat has a bad look,\u201d said Darnay--\u000a\u000a\u201cA bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don\u2019t know what reason\u000athere is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson\u2019s are\u000agetting old, and we really can\u2019t be troubled out of the ordinary course\u000awithout due occasion.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cStill,\u201d said Darnay, \u201cyou know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know that, to be sure,\u201d assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade\u000ahimself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, \u201cbut I\u000aam determined to be peevish after my long day\u2019s botheration. Where is\u000aManette?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHere he is,\u201d said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by\u000awhich I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without\u000areason. You are not going out, I hope?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,\u201d said the\u000aDoctor.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be\u000apitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can\u2019t\u000asee.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course, it has been kept for you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd sleeping soundly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s right; all safe and well! I don\u2019t know why anything should be\u000aotherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out\u000aall day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank ye. Now,\u000acome and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear\u000athe echoes about which you have your theory.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot a theory; it was a fancy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA fancy, then, my wise pet,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. \u201cThey\u000aare very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!\u201d\u000a\u000aHeadlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody\u2019s\u000alife, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the\u000afootsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in\u000athe dark London window.\u000a\u000aSaint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows\u000aheaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy\u000aheads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous\u000aroar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms\u000astruggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind:\u000aall the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a\u000aweapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.\u000a\u000aWho gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what\u000aagency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the\u000aheads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could\u000ahave told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges,\u000apowder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every\u000aweapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who\u000acould lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to\u000aforce stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and\u000aheart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.\u000aEvery living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented\u000awith a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.\u000a\u000aAs a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging\u000acircled round Defarge\u2019s wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron\u000ahad a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,\u000aalready begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,\u000athrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm\u000aanother, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.\u000a\u000a\u201cKeep near to me, Jacques Three,\u201d cried Defarge; \u201cand do you, Jacques\u000aOne and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these\u000apatriots as you can. Where is my wife?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEh, well! Here you see me!\u201d said madame, composed as ever, but not\u000aknitting to-day. Madame\u2019s resolute right hand was occupied with an axe,\u000ain place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol\u000aand a cruel knife.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere do you go, my wife?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI go,\u201d said madame, \u201cwith you at present. You shall see me at the head\u000aof women, by-and-bye.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCome, then!\u201d cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. \u201cPatriots and\u000afriends, we are ready! The Bastille!\u201d\u000a\u000aWith a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped\u000ainto the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on\u000adepth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums\u000abeating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack\u000abegan.\u000a\u000aDeep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great\u000atowers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through\u000athe smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against\u000aa cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the\u000awine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.\u000a\u000aDeep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers,\u000acannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! \u201cWork, comrades\u000aall, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques\u000aTwo Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all\u000athe Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!\u201d Thus Defarge of the\u000awine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo me, women!\u201d cried madame his wife. \u201cWhat! We can kill as well as\u000athe men when the place is taken!\u201d And to her, with a shrill thirsty\u000acry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and\u000arevenge.\u000a\u000aCannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single\u000adrawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight\u000adisplacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing\u000aweapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work\u000aat neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys,\u000aexecrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the\u000afurious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the\u000asingle drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great\u000atowers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot\u000aby the service of Four fierce hours.\u000a\u000aA white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly\u000aperceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly\u000athe sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the\u000awine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer\u000awalls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!\u000a\u000aSo resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to\u000adraw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been\u000astruggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the\u000aouter courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he\u000amade a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his side;\u000aMadame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the\u000ainner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was tumult,\u000aexultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet\u000afurious dumb-show.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Prisoners!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Records!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe secret cells!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe instruments of torture!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Prisoners!\u201d\u000a\u000aOf all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, \u201cThe Prisoners!\u201d was\u000athe cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an\u000aeternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost\u000abillows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and\u000athreatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained\u000aundisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of\u000athese men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his\u000ahand--separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the\u000awall.\u000a\u000a\u201cShow me the North Tower!\u201d said Defarge. \u201cQuick!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will faithfully,\u201d replied the man, \u201cif you will come with me. But\u000athere is no one there.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?\u201d asked\u000aDefarge. \u201cQuick!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe meaning, monsieur?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDoes it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean that I\u000ashall strike you dead?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cKill him!\u201d croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.\u000a\u000a\u201cMonsieur, it is a cell.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShow it me!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPass this way, then.\u201d\u000a\u000aJacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed\u000aby the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed,\u000aheld by Defarge\u2019s arm as he held by the turnkey\u2019s. Their three heads had\u000abeen close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much\u000aas they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the\u000anoise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and\u000aits inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. All around\u000aoutside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,\u000aoccasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the\u000aair like spray.\u000a\u000aThrough gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past\u000ahideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,\u000aand again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry\u000awaterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three,\u000alinked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and\u000athere, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by;\u000abut when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a\u000atower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls\u000aand arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible\u000ato them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had\u000acome had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.\u000a\u000aThe turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung\u000athe door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed\u000ain:\u000a\u000a\u201cOne hundred and five, North Tower!\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,\u000awith a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by\u000astooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred\u000aacross, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes\u000aon the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There were\u000athe four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.\u000a\u000a\u201cPass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,\u201d said\u000aDefarge to the turnkey.\u000a\u000aThe man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.\u000a\u000a\u201cStop!--Look here, Jacques!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA. M.!\u201d croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.\u000a\u000a\u201cAlexandre Manette,\u201d said Defarge in his ear, following the letters\u000awith his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. \u201cAnd here he\u000awrote \u2018a poor physician.\u2019 And it was he, without doubt, who scratched\u000aa calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it\u000ame!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden\u000aexchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and\u000atable, beat them to pieces in a few blows.\u000a\u000a\u201cHold the light higher!\u201d he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. \u201cLook\u000aamong those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,\u201d\u000a throwing it to him; \u201crip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the\u000alight higher, you!\u201d\u000a\u000aWith a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and,\u000apeering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar,\u000aand worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar\u000aand dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and\u000ain it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney\u000ainto which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a\u000acautious touch.\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light\u000athem, you!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping\u000aagain to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and\u000aretraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense\u000aof hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once\u000amore.\u000a\u000aThey found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint\u000aAntoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard\u000aupon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people.\u000aOtherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for\u000ajudgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people\u2019s\u000ablood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be\u000aunavenged.\u000a\u000aIn the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to\u000aencompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red\u000adecoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a\u000awoman\u2019s. \u201cSee, there is my husband!\u201d she cried, pointing him out.\u000a\u201cSee Defarge!\u201d She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and\u000aremained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through\u000athe streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable\u000aclose to him when he was got near his destination, and began to\u000abe struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the\u000along-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him\u000awhen he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot\u000aupon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head.\u000a\u000aThe hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea\u000aof hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. Saint\u000aAntoine\u2019s blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the\u000airon hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the\u000agovernor\u2019s body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge\u000awhere she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. \u201cLower\u000athe lamp yonder!\u201d cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new\u000ameans of death; \u201chere is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!\u201d The\u000aswinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.\u000a\u000aThe sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving\u000aof wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces\u000awere yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes,\u000avoices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering\u000auntil the touch of pity could make no mark on them.\u000a\u000aBut, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was\u000ain vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so\u000afixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore\u000amore memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly\u000areleased by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high\u000aoverhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last\u000aDay were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.\u000aOther seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose\u000adrooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive\u000afaces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them;\u000afaces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped\u000alids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, \u201cTHOU DIDST\u000aIT!\u201d\u000a\u000aSeven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the\u000aaccursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters\u000aand other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken\u000ahearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint\u000aAntoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven\u000ahundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay,\u000aand keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad,\u000aand dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask\u000aat Defarge\u2019s wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once\u000astained red.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXXII. The Sea Still Rises\u000a\u000a\u000aHaggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften\u000ahis modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with\u000athe relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame\u000aDefarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.\u000aMadame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of\u000aSpies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting\u000athemselves to the saint\u2019s mercies. The lamps across his streets had a\u000aportentously elastic swing with them.\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,\u000acontemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several\u000aknots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense\u000aof power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on\u000athe wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: \u201cI know how\u000ahard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself;\u000abut do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to\u000adestroy life in you?\u201d Every lean bare arm, that had been without work\u000abefore, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.\u000aThe fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that\u000athey could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine;\u000athe image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the\u000alast finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was\u000ato be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of her\u000asisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a starved\u000agrocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had\u000aalready earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.\u000a\u000a\u201cHark!\u201d said The Vengeance. \u201cListen, then! Who comes?\u201d\u000a\u000aAs if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine\u000aQuarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading\u000amurmur came rushing along.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is Defarge,\u201d said madame. \u201cSilence, patriots!\u201d\u000a\u000aDefarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked\u000aaround him! \u201cListen, everywhere!\u201d said madame again. \u201cListen to him!\u201d\u000a Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open\u000amouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had\u000asprung to their feet.\u000a\u000a\u201cSay then, my husband. What is it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNews from the other world!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow, then?\u201d cried madame, contemptuously. \u201cThe other world?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDoes everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people\u000athat they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody!\u201d from all throats.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe news is of him. He is among us!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAmong us!\u201d from the universal throat again. \u201cAnd dead?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot dead! He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself\u000ato be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have\u000afound him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. I have\u000aseen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. I have\u000asaid that he had reason to fear us. Say all! _Had_ he reason?\u201d\u000a\u000aWretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had\u000anever known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he\u000acould have heard the answering cry.\u000a\u000aA moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked\u000asteadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum\u000awas heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.\u000a\u000a\u201cPatriots!\u201d said Defarge, in a determined voice, \u201care we ready?\u201d\u000a\u000aInstantly Madame Defarge\u2019s knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating\u000ain the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and\u000aThe Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about\u000aher head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to\u000ahouse, rousing the women.\u000a\u000aThe men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked\u000afrom windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into\u000athe streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From\u000asuch household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their\u000achildren, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground\u000afamished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one\u000aanother, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.\u000aVillain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant\u000aFoulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of\u000athese, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon\u000aalive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon\u000awho told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread\u000ato give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these\u000abreasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our\u000asuffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my\u000aknees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers,\u000aand young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon,\u000aGive us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend\u000aFoulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from\u000ahim! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,\u000awhirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they\u000adropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men\u000abelonging to them from being trampled under foot.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at\u000athe Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew\u000ahis own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out\u000aof the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with\u000asuch a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not\u000aa human creature in Saint Antoine\u2019s bosom but a few old crones and the\u000awailing children.\u000a\u000aNo. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where\u000athis old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent\u000aopen space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance,\u000aand Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance\u000afrom him in the Hall.\u000a\u000a\u201cSee!\u201d cried madame, pointing with her knife. \u201cSee the old villain bound\u000awith ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back.\u000aHa, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!\u201d Madame put her knife\u000aunder her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.\u000a\u000aThe people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of\u000aher satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to\u000aothers, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the\u000aclapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,\u000aand the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge\u2019s frequent\u000aexpressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at\u000aa distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some\u000awonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture\u000ato look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a\u000atelegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.\u000a\u000aAt length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or\u000aprotection, directly down upon the old prisoner\u2019s head. The favour was\u000atoo much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had\u000astood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got\u000ahim!\u000a\u000aIt was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge\u000ahad but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable\u000awretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned\u000aher hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and\u000aJacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows\u000ahad not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high\u000aperches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, \u201cBring him\u000aout! Bring him to the lamp!\u201d\u000a\u000aDown, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on\u000ahis knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at,\u000aand stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his\u000aface by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always\u000aentreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of\u000aaction, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one\u000aanother back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through\u000aa forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one\u000aof the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat\u000amight have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him\u000awhile they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately\u000ascreeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have\u000ahim killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft, and the rope\u000abroke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope\u000abroke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and\u000aheld him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the\u000amouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.\u000a\u000aNor was this the end of the day\u2019s bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted\u000aand danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when\u000athe day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the\u000apeople\u2019s enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard\u000afive hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes\u000aon flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the\u000abreast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on\u000apikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession\u000athrough the streets.\u000a\u000aNot before dark night did the men and women come back to the children,\u000awailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers\u2019 shops were beset by\u000along files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while\u000athey waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by\u000aembracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them\u000aagain in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and\u000afrayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and\u000aslender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in\u000acommon, afterwards supping at their doors.\u000a\u000aScanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of\u000amost other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused\u000asome nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of\u000acheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full\u000ashare in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;\u000aand lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and\u000ahoped.\u000a\u000aIt was almost morning, when Defarge\u2019s wine-shop parted with its last\u000aknot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in\u000ahusky tones, while fastening the door:\u000a\u000a\u201cAt last it is come, my dear!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEh well!\u201d returned madame. \u201cAlmost.\u201d\u000a\u000aSaint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with\u000aher starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum\u2019s was the\u000aonly voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The\u000aVengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had\u000athe same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon\u000awas seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint\u000aAntoine\u2019s bosom.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXXIII. Fire Rises\u000a\u000a\u000aThere was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where\u000athe mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the\u000ahighway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his\u000apoor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the\u000acrag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,\u000abut not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of\u000athem knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not\u000abe what he was ordered.\u000a\u000aFar and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.\u000aEvery green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as\u000ashrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down,\u000adejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated\u000aanimals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn\u000aout.\u000a\u000aMonseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national\u000ablessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of\u000aluxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose;\u000anevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought\u000athings to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for\u000aMonseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must\u000abe something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it\u000awas, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the\u000aflints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that\u000aits purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing\u000ato bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and\u000aunaccountable.\u000a\u000aBut, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like\u000ait. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung\u000ait, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures\u000aof the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting\u000athe beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces\u000aof barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in\u000athe appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the\u000adisappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and\u000abeautifying features of Monseigneur.\u000a\u000aFor, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the\u000adust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and\u000ato dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in\u000athinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if\u000ahe had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour,\u000aand viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on\u000afoot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now\u000aa frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern\u000awithout surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian\u000aaspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a\u000amender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many\u000ahighways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled\u000awith the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.\u000a\u000aSuch a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather,\u000aas he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he\u000acould get from a shower of hail.\u000a\u000aThe man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill,\u000aand at the prison on the crag. When he had identified these objects\u000ain what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just\u000aintelligible:\u000a\u000a\u201cHow goes it, Jacques?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAll well, Jacques.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTouch then!\u201d\u000a\u000aThey joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo dinner?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing but supper now,\u201d said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is the fashion,\u201d growled the man. \u201cI meet no dinner anywhere.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and\u000asteel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held\u000ait from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and\u000athumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.\u000a\u000a\u201cTouch then.\u201d It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this\u000atime, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo-night?\u201d said the mender of roads.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo-night,\u201d said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHere.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at\u000aone another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge\u000aof bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.\u000a\u000a\u201cShow me!\u201d said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.\u000a\u000a\u201cSee!\u201d returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. \u201cYou go down\u000ahere, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo the Devil with all that!\u201d interrupted the other, rolling his eye\u000aover the landscape. \u201c_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains.\u000aWell?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the\u000avillage.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood. When do you cease to work?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt sunset.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWill you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without\u000aresting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child. Will you\u000awake me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSurely.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his\u000agreat wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones. He\u000awas fast asleep directly.\u000a\u000aAs the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling\u000aaway, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to\u000aby silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap\u000anow, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the\u000aheap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used\u000ahis tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.\u000aThe bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen\u000ared cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of\u000abeasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen\u000aand desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender\u000aof roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were\u000afootsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed\u000awith leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long\u000aleagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into\u000asores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at\u000asecret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept\u000awith his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.\u000aFortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and\u000adrawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against\u000athis figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and\u000alooked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no\u000aobstacle, tending to centres all over France.\u000a\u000aThe man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of\u000abrightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps\u000aof dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed\u000athem, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,\u000athe mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready\u000ato go down into the village, roused him.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood!\u201d said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. \u201cTwo leagues beyond the\u000asummit of the hill?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAbout.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAbout. Good!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him\u000aaccording to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,\u000asqueezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and\u000aappearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.\u000aWhen the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,\u000aas it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A\u000acurious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered\u000atogether at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of\u000alooking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,\u000achief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top\u000aalone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his\u000achimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to\u000athe sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need\u000ato ring the tocsin by-and-bye.\u000a\u000aThe night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its\u000asolitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened\u000athe pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace\u000aflights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a\u000aswift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through\u000athe hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the\u000astairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis\u000ahad slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four\u000aheavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the\u000abranches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four\u000alights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all\u000awas black again.\u000a\u000aBut, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely\u000avisible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.\u000aThen, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,\u000apicking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,\u000aand windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.\u000aSoon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the\u000astone faces awakened, stared out of fire.\u000a\u000aA faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left\u000athere, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was\u000aspurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the\u000aspace by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur\u000aGabelle\u2019s door. \u201cHelp, Gabelle! Help, every one!\u201d The tocsin rang\u000aimpatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The\u000amender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood\u000awith folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the\u000asky. \u201cIt must be forty feet high,\u201d said they, grimly; and never moved.\u000a\u000aThe rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away\u000athrough the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on\u000athe crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;\u000aremoved from them, a group of soldiers. \u201cHelp, gentlemen--officers! The\u000achateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by\u000atimely aid! Help, help!\u201d The officers looked towards the soldiers who\u000alooked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting\u000aof lips, \u201cIt must burn.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the\u000avillage was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and\u000afifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of\u000alighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in\u000aevery dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,\u000aoccasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of\u000aMonsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on\u000athat functionary\u2019s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to\u000aauthority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,\u000aand that post-horses would roast.\u000a\u000aThe chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and\u000araging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the\u000ainfernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising\u000aand falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in\u000atorment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the\u000atwo dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke\u000aagain, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake\u000aand contending with the fire.\u000a\u000aThe chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,\u000ascorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce\u000afigures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten\u000alead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran\u000adry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the\u000aheat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and\u000asplits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied\u000abirds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures\u000atrudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded\u000aroads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next\u000adestination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,\u000aabolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.\u000a\u000aNot only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and\u000abell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with\u000athe collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment\u000aof taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter\u000adays--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his\u000ahouse, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,\u000aMonsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel\u000awith himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again\u000awithdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time\u000aresolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man\u000aof retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the\u000aparapet, and crush a man or two below.\u000a\u000aProbably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the\u000adistant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,\u000acombined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an\u000aill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,\u000awhich the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.\u000aA trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of\u000athe black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur\u000aGabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the\u000arush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,\u000aand Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that\u000awhile.\u000a\u000aWithin a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were\u000aother functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom\u000athe rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they\u000ahad been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople\u000aless fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the\u000afunctionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up\u000ain their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,\u000aNorth, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.\u000aThe altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,\u000ano functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate\u000asuccessfully.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock\u000a\u000a\u000aIn such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by\u000athe rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the\u000aflow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on\u000athe shore--three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays\u000aof little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful\u000atissue of the life of her home.\u000a\u000aMany a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in\u000athe corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging\u000afeet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of\u000aa people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in\u000adanger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted\u000ain.\u000a\u000aMonseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of\u000ahis not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as\u000ato incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and\u000athis life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with\u000ainfinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could\u000aask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after\u000aboldly reading the Lord\u2019s Prayer backwards for a great number of years,\u000aand performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no\u000asooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.\u000a\u000aThe shining Bull\u2019s Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the\u000amark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good\u000aeye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer\u2019s pride,\u000aSardanapalus\u2019s luxury, and a mole\u2019s blindness--but it had dropped\u000aout and was gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its\u000aoutermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was\u000aall gone together. Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and\u000a\u201csuspended,\u201d when the last tidings came over.\u000a\u000aThe August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was\u000acome, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.\u000a\u000aAs was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of\u000aMonseigneur, in London, was Tellson\u2019s Bank. Spirits are supposed to\u000ahaunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur\u000awithout a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be.\u000aMoreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most\u000ato be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson\u2019s was a munificent\u000ahouse, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen\u000afrom their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming\u000astorm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made\u000aprovident remittances to Tellson\u2019s, were always to be heard of there\u000aby their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer\u000afrom France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson\u2019s, almost as\u000aa matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson\u2019s was at that\u000atime, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this\u000awas so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in\u000aconsequence so numerous, that Tellson\u2019s sometimes wrote the latest news\u000aout in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran\u000athrough Temple Bar to read.\u000a\u000aOn a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles\u000aDarnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. The\u000apenitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now\u000athe news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an\u000ahour or so of the time of closing.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,\u201d said Charles\u000aDarnay, rather hesitating, \u201cI must still suggest to you--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI understand. That I am too old?\u201d said Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a\u000adisorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Charles,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, \u201cyou touch\u000asome of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe\u000aenough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard\u000aupon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth\u000ainterfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a\u000adisorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our\u000aHouse here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of\u000aold, and is in Tellson\u2019s confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the\u000along journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit\u000amyself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson\u2019s, after all\u000athese years, who ought to be?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI wish I were going myself,\u201d said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly,\u000aand like one thinking aloud.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!\u201d exclaimed Mr.\u000aLorry. \u201cYou wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman born? You\u000aare a wise counsellor.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the\u000athought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through\u000amy mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for\u000athe miserable people, and having abandoned something to them,\u201d he spoke\u000ahere in his former thoughtful manner, \u201cthat one might be listened to,\u000aand might have the power to persuade to some restraint. Only last night,\u000aafter you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you were talking to Lucie,\u201d Mr. Lorry repeated. \u201cYes. I wonder you\u000aare not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to\u000aFrance at this time of day!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHowever, I am not going,\u201d said Charles Darnay, with a smile. \u201cIt is\u000amore to the purpose that you say you are.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles,\u201d Mr. Lorry\u000aglanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, \u201cyou can have no\u000aconception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and\u000aof the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The\u000aLord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers\u000aof people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they\u000amight be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set\u000aafire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these\u000awith the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise\u000agetting of them out of harm\u2019s way, is within the power (without loss of\u000aprecious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall\u000aI hang back, when Tellson\u2019s knows this and says this--Tellson\u2019s, whose\u000abread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about\u000athe joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTut! Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, glancing at\u000athe House again, \u201cyou are to remember, that getting things out of\u000aParis at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an\u000aimpossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought\u000ato us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to\u000awhisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine,\u000aevery one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed\u000athe Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily\u000aas in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd do you really go to-night?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of\u000adelay.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd do you take no one with you?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAll sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing\u000ato say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my\u000abodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.\u000aNobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or\u000aof having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his\u000amaster.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and\u000ayouthfulness.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little\u000acommission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson\u2019s proposal to retire and\u000alive at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry\u2019s usual desk, with\u000aMonseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he\u000awould do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too\u000amuch the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it\u000awas much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this\u000aterrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under\u000athe skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or\u000aomitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched\u000amillions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that\u000ashould have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming,\u000ayears before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such\u000avapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the\u000arestoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself,\u000aand worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured\u000awithout some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was\u000asuch vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood\u000ain his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had\u000aalready made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.\u000a\u000aAmong the talkers, was Stryver, of the King\u2019s Bench Bar, far on his\u000away to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching\u000ato Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating\u000athem from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for\u000aaccomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition\u000aof eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard\u000awith a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between\u000agoing away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his\u000aword, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.\u000a\u000aThe House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter\u000abefore him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to\u000awhom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay\u000athat he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right\u000aname. The address, turned into English, ran:\u000a\u000a\u201cVery pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of\u000aFrance. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,\u000aLondon, England.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and\u000aexpress request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should\u000abe--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate\u000abetween them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no\u000asuspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; \u201cI have referred it,\u000aI think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this\u000agentleman is to be found.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there\u000awas a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry\u2019s desk. He\u000aheld the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the\u000aperson of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at\u000ait in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,\u000aand The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in\u000aEnglish, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.\u000a\u000a\u201cNephew, I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of the\u000apolished Marquis who was murdered,\u201d said one. \u201cHappy to say, I never\u000aknew him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA craven who abandoned his post,\u201d said another--this Monseigneur had\u000abeen got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of\u000ahay--\u201csome years ago.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cInfected with the new doctrines,\u201d said a third, eyeing the direction\u000athrough his glass in passing; \u201cset himself in opposition to the last\u000aMarquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to\u000athe ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHey?\u201d cried the blatant Stryver. \u201cDid he though? Is that the sort of\u000afellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D--n the fellow!\u201d\u000a\u000aDarnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on\u000athe shoulder, and said:\u000a\u000a\u201cI know the fellow.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you, by Jupiter?\u201d said Stryver. \u201cI am sorry for it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, Mr. Darnay? D\u2019ye hear what he did? Don\u2019t ask, why, in these\u000atimes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I do ask why?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to\u000ahear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow,\u000awho, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that\u000aever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth\u000athat ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a\u000aman who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I\u2019ll answer you. I am sorry\u000abecause I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That\u2019s\u000awhy.\u201d\u000a\u000aMindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and\u000asaid: \u201cYou may not understand the gentleman.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay,\u201d said Bully\u000aStryver, \u201cand I\u2019ll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don\u2019t_\u000aunderstand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also\u000atell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position\u000ato this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no,\u000agentlemen,\u201d said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers,\u000a\u201cI know something of human nature, and I tell you that you\u2019ll never\u000afind a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such\u000aprecious _protgs_. No, gentlemen; he\u2019ll always show \u2018em a clean pair\u000aof heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver\u000ashouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of\u000ahis hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk,\u000ain the general departure from the Bank.\u000a\u000a\u201cWill you take charge of the letter?\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cYou know where to\u000adeliver it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWill you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been\u000aaddressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and\u000athat it has been here some time?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom here, at eight.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will come back, to see you off.\u201d\u000a\u000aVery ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men,\u000aDarnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the\u000aletter, and read it. These were its contents:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cPrison of the Abbaye, Paris.\u000a\u000a\u201cJune 21, 1792. \u201cMONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.\u000a\u000a\u201cAfter having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the\u000avillage, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and\u000abrought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a\u000agreat deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the\u000aground.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,\u000aand for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my\u000alife (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against\u000athe majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an\u000aemigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not\u000aagainst, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that,\u000abefore the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the\u000aimposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had\u000ahad recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for\u000aan emigrant, and where is that emigrant?\u000a\u000a\u201cAh! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that\u000aemigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will he\u000anot come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,\u000aI send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your\u000aears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!\u000a\u000a\u201cFor the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of\u000ayour noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to\u000asuccour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh\u000aMonsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and\u000anearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the\u000aassurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.\u000a\u000a\u201cYour afflicted,\u000a\u000a\u201cGabelle.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000aThe latent uneasiness in Darnay\u2019s mind was roused to vigourous life\u000aby this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose\u000aonly crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so\u000areproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple\u000aconsidering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.\u000a\u000aHe knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated\u000athe bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his\u000aresentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his\u000aconscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold,\u000ahe had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie,\u000ahis renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own\u000amind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have\u000asystematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to\u000ado it, and that it had never been done.\u000a\u000aThe happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being\u000aalways actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time\u000awhich had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week\u000aannihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week\u000afollowing made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of\u000athese circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still\u000awithout continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched\u000athe times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled\u000auntil the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from\u000aFrance by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of\u000aconfiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out,\u000awas as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in\u000aFrance that might impeach him for it.\u000a\u000aBut, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so\u000afar from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had\u000arelinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no\u000afavour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own\u000abread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate\u000aon written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little\u000athere was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have\u000ain the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in\u000athe summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his\u000aown safety, so that it could not but appear now.\u000a\u000aThis favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make,\u000athat he would go to Paris.\u000a\u000aYes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven\u000ahim within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him\u000ato itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted\u000ahim on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible\u000aattraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being\u000aworked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who\u000acould not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,\u000atrying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy\u000aand humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching\u000ahim, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the\u000abrave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison\u000a(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,\u000awhich had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were\u000acoarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle\u2019s\u000aletter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his\u000ajustice, honour, and good name.\u000a\u000aHis resolution was made. He must go to Paris.\u000a\u000aYes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he\u000astruck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention\u000awith which he had done what he had done, even although he had left\u000ait incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be\u000agratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert\u000ait. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the\u000asanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even\u000asaw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging\u000aRevolution that was running so fearfully wild.\u000a\u000aAs he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that\u000aneither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone.\u000aLucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always\u000areluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old,\u000ashould come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in\u000athe balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his\u000asituation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety\u000ato avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not\u000adiscuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence\u000ain his course.\u000a\u000aHe walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to\u000areturn to Tellson\u2019s and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived\u000ain Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say\u000anothing of his intention now.\u000a\u000aA carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was\u000abooted and equipped.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have delivered that letter,\u201d said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. \u201cI\u000awould not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but\u000aperhaps you will take a verbal one?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat I will, and readily,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cif it is not dangerous.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is his name?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his\u000ahand.\u000a\u000a\u201cGabelle.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSimply, \u2018that he has received the letter, and will come.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAny time mentioned?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe will start upon his journey to-morrow night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAny person mentioned?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks,\u000aand went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the\u000amisty air of Fleet-street. \u201cMy love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,\u201d said\u000aMr. Lorry at parting, \u201cand take precious care of them till I come back.\u201d\u000a Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage\u000arolled away.\u000a\u000aThat night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote\u000atwo fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation\u000ahe was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons\u000athat he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no\u000apersonal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and\u000atheir dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the\u000astrongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters\u000ain proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.\u000a\u000aIt was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first\u000areservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to\u000apreserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious.\u000aBut, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him\u000aresolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,\u000aso strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and\u000athe day passed quickly. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her\u000ascarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye\u000a(an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise\u000aof clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy\u000astreets, with a heavier heart.\u000a\u000aThe unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides\u000aand winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left his\u000atwo letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before\u000amidnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey.\u000a\u201cFor the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of\u000ayour noble name!\u201d was the poor prisoner\u2019s cry with which he strengthened\u000ahis sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and\u000afloated away for the Loadstone Rock.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe end of the second book.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBook the Third--the Track of a Storm\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI. In Secret\u000a\u000a\u000aThe traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from\u000aEngland in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and\u000aninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad\u000ahorses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and\u000aunfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;\u000abut, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than\u000athese. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of\u000acitizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state\u000aof readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them,\u000ainspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own,\u000aturned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in\u000ahold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning\u000aRepublic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or\u000aDeath.\u000a\u000aA very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles\u000aDarnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there\u000awas no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen\u000aat Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey\u2019s end.\u000aNot a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across\u000athe road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in\u000athe series that was barred between him and England. The universal\u000awatchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net,\u000aor were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have\u000afelt his freedom more completely gone.\u000a\u000aThis universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty\u000atimes in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by\u000ariding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him\u000aby anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been\u000adays upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in\u000aa little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.\u000a\u000aNothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle\u2019s letter from his\u000aprison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the\u000aguard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey\u000ato have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as\u000aa man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he\u000ahad been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.\u000a\u000aAwakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough\u000ared caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.\u000a\u000a\u201cEmigrant,\u201d said the functionary, \u201cI am going to send you on to Paris,\u000aunder an escort.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCitizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could\u000adispense with the escort.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSilence!\u201d growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end\u000aof his musket. \u201cPeace, aristocrat!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is as the good patriot says,\u201d observed the timid functionary. \u201cYou\u000aare an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have no choice,\u201d said Charles Darnay.\u000a\u000a\u201cChoice! Listen to him!\u201d cried the same scowling red-cap. \u201cAs if it was\u000anot a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is always as the good patriot says,\u201d observed the functionary. \u201cRise\u000aand dress yourself, emigrant.\u201d\u000a\u000aDarnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other\u000apatriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by\u000aa watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he\u000astarted with it on the wet, wet roads at three o\u2019clock in the morning.\u000a\u000aThe escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured\u000acockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either\u000aside of him.\u000a\u000aThe escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to\u000ahis bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his\u000awrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their\u000afaces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,\u000aand out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without\u000achange, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay\u000abetween them and the capital.\u000a\u000aThey travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and\u000alying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed,\u000athat they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged\u000ashoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of\u000abeing so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger\u000aas arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying\u000ahis musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint\u000athat was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,\u000ahe reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits\u000aof an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,\u000aconfirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.\u000a\u000aBut when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,\u000awhen the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from\u000ahimself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd\u000agathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called\u000aout loudly, \u201cDown with the emigrant!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,\u000aresuming it as his safest place, said:\u000a\u000a\u201cEmigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own\u000awill?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are a cursed emigrant,\u201d cried a farrier, making at him in a\u000afurious manner through the press, hammer in hand; \u201cand you are a cursed\u000aaristocrat!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider\u2019s\u000abridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, \u201cLet him\u000abe; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJudged!\u201d repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. \u201cAy! and condemned\u000aas a traitor.\u201d At this the crowd roared approval.\u000a\u000aChecking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse\u2019s head to the\u000ayard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with\u000athe line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his\u000avoice heard:\u000a\u000a\u201cFriends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a\u000atraitor.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe lies!\u201d cried the smith. \u201cHe is a traitor since the decree. His life\u000ais forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which\u000aanother instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his\u000ahorse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse\u2019s flanks,\u000aand the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier\u000astruck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no\u000amore was done.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is this decree that the smith spoke of?\u201d Darnay asked the\u000apostmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.\u000a\u000a\u201cTruly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen passed?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOn the fourteenth.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe day I left England!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be\u000aothers--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and\u000acondemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said\u000ayour life was not your own.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut there are no such decrees yet?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do I know!\u201d said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; \u201cthere\u000amay be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?\u201d\u000a\u000aThey rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and\u000athen rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many\u000awild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride\u000aunreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and\u000alonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor\u000acottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and\u000awould find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,\u000acircling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn\u000aup together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in\u000aBeauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more\u000ainto solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and\u000awet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth\u000athat year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by\u000athe sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their\u000away, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.\u000a\u000aDaylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was\u000aclosed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere are the papers of this prisoner?\u201d demanded a resolute-looking man\u000ain authority, who was summoned out by the guard.\u000a\u000aNaturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the\u000aspeaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen,\u000ain charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had\u000aimposed upon him, and which he had paid for.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere,\u201d repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him\u000awhatever, \u201care the papers of this prisoner?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his\u000aeyes over Gabelle\u2019s letter, the same personage in authority showed some\u000adisorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.\u000a\u000aHe left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went\u000ainto the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the\u000agate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles\u000aDarnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and\u000apatriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress\u000ainto the city for peasants\u2019 carts bringing in supplies, and for similar\u000atraffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest\u000apeople, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not\u000ato mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue\u000aforth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they\u000afiltered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew\u000atheir turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the\u000aground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered\u000aabout. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men\u000aand women.\u000a\u000aWhen he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these\u000athings, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,\u000awho directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the\u000aescort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him\u000ato dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,\u000aturned and rode away without entering the city.\u000a\u000aHe accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine\u000aand tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,\u000adrunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and\u000awaking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The\u000alight in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of\u000athe night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly\u000auncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an\u000aofficer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.\u000a\u000a\u201cCitizen Defarge,\u201d said he to Darnay\u2019s conductor, as he took a slip of\u000apaper to write on. \u201cIs this the emigrant Evremonde?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the man.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour age, Evremonde?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThirty-seven.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMarried, Evremonde?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere married?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn England.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWithout doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn England.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWithout doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La\u000aForce.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJust Heaven!\u201d exclaimed Darnay. \u201cUnder what law, and for what offence?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here.\u201d He\u000asaid it with a hard smile, and went on writing.\u000a\u000a\u201cI entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response\u000ato that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I\u000ademand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that\u000amy right?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEmigrants have no rights, Evremonde,\u201d was the stolid reply. The officer\u000awrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,\u000asanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words \u201cIn secret.\u201d\u000a\u000aDefarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany\u000ahim. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended\u000athem.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs it you,\u201d said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the\u000aguardhouse steps and turned into Paris, \u201cwho married the daughter of\u000aDoctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint\u000aAntoine. Possibly you have heard of me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe word \u201cwife\u201d seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say\u000awith sudden impatience, \u201cIn the name of that sharp female newly-born,\u000aand called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the\u000atruth?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA bad truth for you,\u201d said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and\u000alooking straight before him.\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so\u000asudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a\u000alittle help?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNone.\u201d Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.\u000a\u000a\u201cWill you answer me a single question?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free\u000acommunication with the world outside?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou will see.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of\u000apresenting my case?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried\u000ain worse prisons, before now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut never by me, Citizen Defarge.\u201d\u000a\u000aDefarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady\u000aand set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope\u000athere was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.\u000aHe, therefore, made haste to say:\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better\u000athan I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to\u000aMr. Lorry of Tellson\u2019s Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,\u000athe simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the\u000aprison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will do,\u201d Defarge doggedly rejoined, \u201cnothing for you. My duty is to\u000amy country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you.\u000aI will do nothing for you.\u201d\u000a\u000aCharles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride\u000awas touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see\u000ahow used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the\u000astreets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned\u000atheir heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;\u000aotherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no\u000amore remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be\u000agoing to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they\u000apassed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited\u000aaudience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal\u000afamily. The few words that he caught from this man\u2019s lips, first made\u000ait known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the\u000aforeign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at\u000aBeauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal\u000awatchfulness had completely isolated him.\u000a\u000aThat he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had\u000adeveloped themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That\u000aperils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster\u000ayet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he\u000amight not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events\u000aof a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by\u000athe light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future\u000awas, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant\u000ahope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few\u000arounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed\u000agarnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had\u000abeen a hundred thousand years away. The \u201csharp female newly-born, and\u000acalled La Guillotine,\u201d was hardly known to him, or to the generality\u000aof people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were\u000aprobably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could\u000athey have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?\u000a\u000aOf unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation\u000afrom his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the\u000acertainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on\u000ahis mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he\u000aarrived at the prison of La Force.\u000a\u000aA man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge\u000apresented \u201cThe Emigrant Evremonde.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat the Devil! How many more of them!\u201d exclaimed the man with the\u000abloated face.\u000a\u000aDefarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew,\u000awith his two fellow-patriots.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat the Devil, I say again!\u201d exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife.\u000a\u201cHow many more!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe gaoler\u2019s wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely\u000areplied, \u201cOne must have patience, my dear!\u201d Three turnkeys who entered\u000aresponsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, \u201cFor\u000athe love of Liberty;\u201d which sounded in that place like an inappropriate\u000aconclusion.\u000a\u000aThe prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a\u000ahorrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome\u000aflavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that\u000aare ill cared for!\u000a\u000a\u201cIn secret, too,\u201d grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. \u201cAs\u000aif I was not already full to bursting!\u201d\u000a\u000aHe stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay\u000aawaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and\u000afro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in\u000aeither case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his\u000asubordinates.\u000a\u000a\u201cCome!\u201d said the chief, at length taking up his keys, \u201ccome with me,\u000aemigrant.\u201d\u000a\u000aThrough the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by\u000acorridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,\u000auntil they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with\u000aprisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading\u000aand writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the\u000amost part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the\u000aroom.\u000a\u000aIn the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and\u000adisgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning\u000aunreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to\u000areceive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with\u000aall the engaging graces and courtesies of life.\u000a\u000aSo strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and\u000agloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and\u000amisery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand\u000ain a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost\u000aof stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of\u000afrivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all\u000awaiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes\u000athat were changed by the death they had died in coming there.\u000a\u000aIt struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other\u000agaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance\u000ain the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly\u000acoarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were\u000athere--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the\u000amature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and\u000alikelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its\u000autmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress\u000aof disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,\u201d said a\u000agentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, \u201cI have the\u000ahonour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you\u000aon the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate\u000ahappily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,\u000ato ask your name and condition?\u201d\u000a\u000aCharles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in\u000awords as suitable as he could find.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I hope,\u201d said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his\u000aeyes, who moved across the room, \u201cthat you are not in secret?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say\u000aso.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several\u000amembers of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted\u000abut a short time.\u201d Then he added, raising his voice, \u201cI grieve to inform\u000athe society--in secret.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room\u000ato a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among\u000awhich, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave\u000ahim good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to\u000arender the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler\u2019s hand; and\u000athe apparitions vanished from his sight forever.\u000a\u000aThe wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had\u000aascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted\u000athem), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a\u000asolitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.\u000a\u000a\u201cYours,\u201d said the gaoler.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy am I confined alone?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow do I know!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can buy pen, ink, and paper?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSuch are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At\u000apresent, you may buy your food, and nothing more.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As\u000athe gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four\u000awalls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of\u000athe prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler\u000awas so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like\u000aa man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was\u000agone, he thought in the same wandering way, \u201cNow am I left, as if I were\u000adead.\u201d Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it\u000awith a sick feeling, and thought, \u201cAnd here in these crawling creatures\u000ais the first condition of the body after death.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFive paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five\u000apaces by four and a half.\u201d The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,\u000acounting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled\u000adrums with a wild swell of voices added to them. \u201cHe made shoes, he made\u000ashoes, he made shoes.\u201d The prisoner counted the measurement again, and\u000apaced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.\u000a\u201cThe ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among\u000athem, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the\u000aembrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden\u000ahair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God\u2019s sake,\u000athrough the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He\u000amade shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and\u000aa half.\u201d With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of\u000ahis mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting\u000aand counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it\u000astill rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he\u000aknew, in the swell that rose above them.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aII. The Grindstone\u000a\u000a\u000aTellson\u2019s Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was\u000ain a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from\u000athe street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to\u000aa great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the\u000atroubles, in his own cook\u2019s dress, and got across the borders. A\u000amere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his\u000ametempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation\u000aof whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men\u000abesides the cook in question.\u000a\u000aMonseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the\u000asin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and\u000awilling to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and\u000aindivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur\u2019s\u000ahouse had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all\u000athings moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce\u000aprecipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month\u000aof September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of\u000aMonseigneur\u2019s house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were\u000adrinking brandy in its state apartments.\u000a\u000aA place of business in London like Tellson\u2019s place of business in Paris,\u000awould soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.\u000aFor, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have\u000asaid to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid\u000aover the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson\u2019s had whitewashed the\u000aCupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest\u000alinen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to\u000anight. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in\u000aLombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of\u000athe immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and\u000aalso of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest\u000aprovocation. Yet, a French Tellson\u2019s could get on with these things\u000aexceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had\u000ataken fright at them, and drawn out his money.\u000a\u000aWhat money would be drawn out of Tellson\u2019s henceforth, and what would\u000alie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in\u000aTellson\u2019s hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons,\u000aand when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with\u000aTellson\u2019s never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into\u000athe next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis\u000aLorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by\u000aa newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was\u000aprematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a\u000adeeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the\u000aroom distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.\u000a\u000aHe occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which\u000ahe had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they\u000aderived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main\u000abuilding, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about\u000athat. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did\u000ahis duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,\u000awas extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages\u000aof Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two\u000agreat flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the\u000aopen air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared\u000ato have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,\u000aor other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless\u000aobjects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had\u000aopened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and\u000ahe had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.\u000a\u000aFrom the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came\u000athe usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring\u000ain it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible\u000anature were going up to Heaven.\u000a\u000a\u201cThank God,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, \u201cthat no one near and\u000adear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy on all\u000awho are in danger!\u201d\u000a\u000aSoon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,\u000a\u201cThey have come back!\u201d and sat listening. But, there was no loud\u000airruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate\u000aclash again, and all was quiet.\u000a\u000aThe nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague\u000auneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally\u000aawaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to\u000ago among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly\u000aopened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in\u000aamazement.\u000a\u000aLucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with\u000athat old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it\u000aseemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give\u000aforce and power to it in this one passage of her life.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is this?\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. \u201cWhat is the\u000amatter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here?\u000aWhat is it?\u201d\u000a\u000aWith the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted\u000aout in his arms, imploringly, \u201cO my dear friend! My husband!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour husband, Lucie?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCharles.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat of Charles?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHere.\u000a\u000a\u201cHere, in Paris?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHas been here some days--three or four--I don\u2019t know how many--I can\u2019t\u000acollect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to\u000aus; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the\u000abell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices\u000acame pouring into the courtyard.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is that noise?\u201d said the Doctor, turning towards the window.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry. \u201cDon\u2019t look out! Manette, for your life,\u000adon\u2019t touch the blind!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and\u000asaid, with a cool, bold smile:\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been\u000aa Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In\u000aFrance--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would\u000atouch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.\u000aMy old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the\u000abarrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I\u000aknew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I\u000atold Lucie so.--What is that noise?\u201d His hand was again upon the window.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. \u201cNo, Lucie, my\u000adear, nor you!\u201d He got his arm round her, and held her. \u201cDon\u2019t be so\u000aterrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm\u000ahaving happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in\u000athis fatal place. What prison is he in?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLa Force!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLa Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in\u000ayour life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to\u000ado exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or\u000aI can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;\u000ayou cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you\u000ato do for Charles\u2019s sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must\u000ainstantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a\u000aroom at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for\u000atwo minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not\u000adelay.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do\u000anothing else than this. I know you are true.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the\u000akey; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and\u000apartly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor\u2019s arm, and\u000alooked out with him into the courtyard.\u000a\u000aLooked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near\u000aenough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The\u000apeople in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they\u000ahad rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up\u000athere for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.\u000a\u000aBut, such awful workers, and such awful work!\u000a\u000aThe grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two\u000amen, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of\u000athe grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than\u000athe visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.\u000aFalse eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their\u000ahideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with\u000ahowling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of\u000asleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung\u000aforward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women\u000aheld wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping\u000ablood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks\u000astruck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and\u000afire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from\u000athe smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the\u000asharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all\u000aover their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain\u000aupon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women\u2019s lace\u000aand silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through\u000aand through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be\u000asharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to\u000athe wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments\u000aof dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And\u000aas the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream\u000aof sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in\u000atheir frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have\u000agiven twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.\u000a\u000aAll this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of\u000aany human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it\u000awere there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for\u000aexplanation in his friend\u2019s ashy face.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are,\u201d Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at\u000athe locked room, \u201cmurdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you\u000asay; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you\u000ahave--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It\u000amay be too late, I don\u2019t know, but let it not be a minute later!\u201d\u000a\u000aDoctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,\u000aand was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.\u000a\u000aHis streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous\u000aconfidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,\u000acarried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.\u000aFor a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and\u000athe unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,\u000asurrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all\u000alinked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with\u000acries of--\u201cLive the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner\u2019s\u000akindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save\u000athe prisoner Evremonde at La Force!\u201d and a thousand answering shouts.\u000a\u000aHe closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window\u000aand the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was\u000aassisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found\u000aher child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be\u000asurprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat\u000awatching them in such quiet as the night knew.\u000a\u000aLucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,\u000aclinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own\u000abed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty\u000acharge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O\u000athe long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!\u000a\u000aTwice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the\u000airruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.\u000a\u201cWhat is it?\u201d cried Lucie, affrighted. \u201cHush! The soldiers\u2019 swords are\u000asharpened there,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cThe place is national property now,\u000aand used as a kind of armoury, my love.\u201d\u000a\u000aTwice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.\u000aSoon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself\u000afrom the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so\u000abesmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back\u000ato consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by\u000athe side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.\u000aShortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of\u000athe carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,\u000aclimbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its\u000adainty cushions.\u000a\u000aThe great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,\u000aand the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood\u000aalone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had\u000anever given, and would never take away.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIII. The Shadow\u000a\u000a\u000aOne of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.\u000aLorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to\u000aimperil Tellson\u2019s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under\u000athe Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded\u000afor Lucie and her child, without a moment\u2019s demur; but the great trust\u000ahe held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict\u000aman of business.\u000a\u000aAt first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out\u000athe wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to\u000athe safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the\u000asame consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the\u000amost violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in\u000aits dangerous workings.\u000a\u000aNoon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute\u2019s delay\u000atending to compromise Tellson\u2019s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said\u000athat her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that\u000aQuarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to\u000athis, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and\u000ahe were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry\u000awent out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up\u000ain a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows\u000aof a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.\u000a\u000aTo this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:\u000agiving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.\u000aHe left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear\u000aconsiderable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations.\u000aA disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly\u000aand heavily the day lagged on with him.\u000a\u000aIt wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He\u000awas again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to\u000ado next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a\u000aman stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,\u000aaddressed him by his name.\u000a\u000a\u201cYour servant,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cDo you know me?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five\u000ato fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of\u000aemphasis, the words:\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you know me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have seen you somewhere.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps at my wine-shop?\u201d\u000a\u000aMuch interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: \u201cYou come from Doctor\u000aManette?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes. I come from Doctor Manette.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd what says he? What does he send me?\u201d\u000a\u000aDefarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the\u000awords in the Doctor\u2019s writing:\u000a\u000a    \u201cCharles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.\u000a     I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note\u000a     from Charles to his wife.  Let the bearer see his wife.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was dated from La Force, within an hour.\u000a\u000a\u201cWill you accompany me,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading\u000athis note aloud, \u201cto where his wife resides?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d returned Defarge.\u000a\u000aScarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical\u000away Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the\u000acourtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.\u000a\u000a\u201cMadame Defarge, surely!\u201d said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly\u000athe same attitude some seventeen years ago.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is she,\u201d observed her husband.\u000a\u000a\u201cDoes Madame go with us?\u201d inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as\u000athey moved.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.\u000aIt is for their safety.\u201d\u000a\u000aBeginning to be struck by Defarge\u2019s manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously\u000aat him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being\u000aThe Vengeance.\u000a\u000aThey passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,\u000aascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,\u000aand found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the\u000atidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that\u000adelivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in\u000athe night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.\u000a\u000a     \u201cDEAREST,--Take courage.  I am well, and your father has\u000a      influence around me.  You cannot answer this.\u000a      Kiss our child for me.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received\u000ait, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the\u000ahands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly\u000aaction, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took\u000ato its knitting again.\u000a\u000aThere was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in\u000athe act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her\u000aneck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted\u000aeyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; \u201cthere are frequent\u000arisings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever\u000atrouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power\u000ato protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she\u000amay identify them. I believe,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his\u000areassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself\u000aupon him more and more, \u201cI state the case, Citizen Defarge?\u201d\u000a\u000aDefarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a\u000agruff sound of acquiescence.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou had better, Lucie,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to\u000apropitiate, by tone and manner, \u201chave the dear child here, and our\u000agood Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no\u000aFrench.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a\u000amatch for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,\u000aappeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,\u000awhom her eyes first encountered, \u201cWell, I am sure, Boldface! I hope\u000a_you_ are pretty well!\u201d She also bestowed a British cough on Madame\u000aDefarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs that his child?\u201d said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the\u000afirst time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it\u000awere the finger of Fate.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, madame,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry; \u201cthis is our poor prisoner\u2019s darling\u000adaughter, and only child.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so\u000athreatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively\u000akneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The\u000ashadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,\u000athreatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is enough, my husband,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cI have seen them. We\u000amay go.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and\u000apresented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as\u000ashe laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge\u2019s dress:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will\u000ahelp me to see him if you can?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYour husband is not my business here,\u201d returned Madame Defarge, looking\u000adown at her with perfect composure. \u201cIt is the daughter of your father\u000awho is my business here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child\u2019s sake! She\u000awill put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more\u000aafraid of you than of these others.\u201d\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.\u000aDefarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,\u000acollected his face into a sterner expression.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is it that your husband says in that little letter?\u201d asked Madame\u000aDefarge, with a lowering smile. \u201cInfluence; he says something touching\u000ainfluence?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat my father,\u201d said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her\u000abreast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, \u201chas\u000amuch influence around him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSurely it will release him!\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cLet it do so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a wife and mother,\u201d cried Lucie, most earnestly, \u201cI implore you to\u000ahave pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against\u000amy innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think\u000aof me. As a wife and mother!\u201d\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,\u000aturning to her friend The Vengeance:\u000a\u000a\u201cThe wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little\u000aas this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have\u000aknown _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,\u000aoften enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in\u000athemselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,\u000asickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have seen nothing else,\u201d returned The Vengeance.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have borne this a long time,\u201d said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes\u000aagain upon Lucie. \u201cJudge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife\u000aand mother would be much to us now?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge\u000awent last, and closed the door.\u000a\u000a\u201cCourage, my dear Lucie,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. \u201cCourage,\u000acourage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of\u000alate gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a\u000ashadow on me and on all my hopes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTut, tut!\u201d said Mr. Lorry; \u201cwhat is this despondency in the brave\u000alittle breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself,\u000afor all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIV. Calm in Storm\u000a\u000a\u000aDoctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his\u000aabsence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be\u000akept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that\u000anot until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she\u000aknow that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all\u000aages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been\u000adarkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been\u000atainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon\u000athe prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that\u000asome had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.\u000a\u000aTo Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on\u000awhich he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a\u000ascene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had\u000afound a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were\u000abrought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth\u000ato be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back\u000ato their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he\u000ahad announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen\u000ayears a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the\u000abody so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this\u000aman was Defarge.\u000a\u000aThat, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,\u000athat his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard\u000ato the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some\u000adirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life\u000aand liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as\u000aa notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded\u000ato him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and\u000aexamined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when\u000athe tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible\u000ato the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,\u000athe man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that\u000athe prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held\u000ainviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner\u000awas removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the\u000aDoctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and\u000aassure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,\u000adelivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had\u000aoften drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and\u000ahad remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.\u000a\u000aThe sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by\u000aintervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were\u000asaved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against\u000athose who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had\u000abeen discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had\u000athrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress\u000athe wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him\u000ain the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies\u000aof their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this\u000aawful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man\u000awith the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him\u000acarefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged\u000aanew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes\u000awith his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.\u000a\u000aAs Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of\u000ahis friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that\u000asuch dread experiences would revive the old danger.\u000a\u000aBut, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never\u000aat all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor\u000afelt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time\u000ahe felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which\u000acould break the prison door of his daughter\u2019s husband, and deliver him.\u000a\u201cIt all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.\u000aAs my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be\u000ahelpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid\u000aof Heaven I will do it!\u201d Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw\u000athe kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing\u000aof the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a\u000aclock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which\u000ahad lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.\u000a\u000aGreater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would\u000ahave yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself\u000ain his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees\u000aof mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his\u000apersonal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician\u000aof three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie\u000athat her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the\u000ageneral body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet\u000amessages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself\u000asent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor\u2019s hand), but she was\u000anot permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of\u000aplots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were\u000aknown to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.\u000a\u000aThis new life of the Doctor\u2019s was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the\u000asagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.\u000aNothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;\u000abut he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that\u000atime, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter\u000aand his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.\u000aNow that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through\u000athat old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles\u2019s\u000aultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,\u000athat he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to\u000atrust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself\u000aand Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and\u000aaffection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in\u000arendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. \u201cAll\u000acurious to see,\u201d thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, \u201cbut all\u000anatural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it\u000acouldn\u2019t be in better hands.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get\u000aCharles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,\u000athe public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new\u000aera began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of\u000aLiberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death\u000aagainst the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the\u000agreat towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise\u000aagainst the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils\u000aof France, as if the dragon\u2019s teeth had been sown broadcast, and\u000ahad yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and\u000aalluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of\u000athe North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds\u000aand among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the\u000afruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.\u000aWhat private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year\u000aOne of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above,\u000aand with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!\u000a\u000aThere was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no\u000ameasurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when\u000atime was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other\u000acount of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever\u000aof a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the\u000aunnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the\u000ahead of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the\u000ahead of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned\u000awidowhood and misery, to turn it grey.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in\u000aall such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A\u000arevolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand\u000arevolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected,\u000awhich struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over\u000aany good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged\u000awith people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;\u000athese things became the established order and nature of appointed\u000athings, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.\u000aAbove all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before\u000athe general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the\u000asharp female called La Guillotine.\u000a\u000aIt was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,\u000ait infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a\u000apeculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which\u000ashaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window\u000aand sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the\u000ahuman race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts\u000afrom which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and\u000abelieved in where the Cross was denied.\u000a\u000aIt sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted,\u000awere a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young\u000aDevil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed\u000athe eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and\u000agood. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one\u000adead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.\u000aThe name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief\u000afunctionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his\u000anamesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God\u2019s own Temple every\u000aday.\u000a\u000aAmong these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked\u000awith a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his\u000aend, never doubting that he would save Lucie\u2019s husband at last. Yet the\u000acurrent of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time\u000aaway so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three\u000amonths when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more\u000awicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,\u000athat the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the\u000aviolently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares\u000aunder the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the\u000aterrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at\u000athat day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable\u000ain hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and\u000avictims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the\u000aappearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all\u000aother men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if\u000ahe had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were\u000aa Spirit moving among mortals.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aV. The Wood-Sawyer\u000a\u000a\u000aOne year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never\u000asure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her\u000ahusband\u2019s head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the\u000atumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright\u000awomen, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and\u000aold; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all\u000adaily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons,\u000aand carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst.\u000aLiberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to\u000abestow, O Guillotine!\u000a\u000aIf the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time,\u000ahad stunned the Doctor\u2019s daughter into awaiting the result in idle\u000adespair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from\u000athe hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in\u000athe garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was\u000atruest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good\u000awill always be.\u000a\u000aAs soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father\u000ahad entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little\u000ahousehold as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had\u000aits appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught,\u000aas regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The\u000aslight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief\u000athat they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his speedy\u000areturn, the setting aside of his chair and his books--these, and the\u000asolemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many\u000aunhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only\u000aoutspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.\u000a\u000aShe did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin to\u000amourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well\u000aattended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her colour,\u000aand the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional,\u000athing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at\u000anight on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had\u000arepressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven,\u000awas on him. He always resolutely answered: \u201cNothing can happen to him\u000awithout my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her\u000afather said to her, on coming home one evening:\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can\u000asometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to\u000ait--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you\u000ain the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can\u000ashow you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even\u000aif you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cO show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrom that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the\u000aclock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.\u000aWhen it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they\u000awent together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a\u000asingle day.\u000a\u000aIt was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel\u000aof a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that\u000aend; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed\u000aher.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood day, citizeness.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood day, citizen.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been\u000aestablished voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;\u000abut, was now law for everybody.\u000a\u000a\u201cWalking here again, citizeness?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou see me, citizen!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he\u000ahad once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed\u000aat the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent\u000abars, peeped through them jocosely.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut it\u2019s not my business,\u201d said he. And went on sawing his wood.\u000a\u000aNext day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she\u000aappeared.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat? Walking here again, citizeness?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, citizen.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo I say yes, mamma?\u201d whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, dearest.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, citizen.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh! But it\u2019s not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I\u000acall it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head\u000acomes!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.\u000a\u000a\u201cI call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again!\u000aLoo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off _her_ head comes! Now, a child.\u000aTickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off _its_ head comes. All the\u000afamily!\u201d\u000a\u000aLucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was\u000aimpossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in\u000ahis sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him\u000afirst, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.\u000a\u000aHe was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten\u000ahim in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart\u000aup to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her,\u000awith his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. \u201cBut it\u2019s\u000anot my business!\u201d he would generally say at those times, and would\u000abriskly fall to his sawing again.\u000a\u000aIn all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of\u000aspring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again\u000ain the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at\u000athis place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.\u000aHer husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in\u000afive or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not\u000afor a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did\u000asee her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have\u000awaited out the day, seven days a week.\u000a\u000aThese occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her\u000afather walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing\u000aafternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild\u000arejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along,\u000adecorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them;\u000aalso, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription\u000a(tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible.\u000aLiberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!\u000a\u000aThe miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole\u000asurface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got\u000asomebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in\u000awith most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike\u000aand cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his\u000asaw inscribed as his \u201cLittle Sainte Guillotine\u201d--for the great sharp\u000afemale was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he\u000awas not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.\u000a\u000aBut, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement\u000aand a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment\u000aafterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the\u000aprison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with\u000aThe Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and\u000athey were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music\u000athan their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song,\u000akeeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.\u000aMen and women danced together, women danced together, men danced\u000atogether, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a\u000amere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they\u000afilled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly\u000aapparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They\u000aadvanced, retreated, struck at one another\u2019s hands, clutched at one\u000aanother\u2019s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round\u000ain pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest\u000alinked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,\u000aand in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they\u000aall stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then\u000areversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped\u000aagain, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width\u000aof the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high\u000aup, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible\u000aas this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once\u000ainnocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into\u000aa means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the\u000aheart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how\u000awarped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly\u000abosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child\u2019s head thus distracted, the\u000adelicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of\u000athe disjointed time.\u000a\u000aThis was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and\u000abewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer\u2019s house, the feathery snow\u000afell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.\u000a\u000a\u201cO my father!\u201d for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she\u000ahad momentarily darkened with her hand; \u201csuch a cruel, bad sight.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don\u2019t be\u000afrightened! Not one of them would harm you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my\u000ahusband, and the mercies of these people--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing to\u000athe window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You may\u000akiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou cannot see him, my poor dear?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, father,\u201d said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand,\u000a\u201cno.\u201d\u000a\u000aA footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. \u201cI salute you, citizeness,\u201d\u000a from the Doctor. \u201cI salute you, citizen.\u201d This in passing. Nothing more.\u000aMadame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.\u000a\u000a\u201cGive me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness\u000aand courage, for his sake. That was well done;\u201d they had left the spot;\u000a\u201cit shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor to-morrow!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions\u000ato be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned\u000abefore the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I know\u000athat he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the\u000aConciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe could scarcely answer, \u201cI trust in you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall\u000abe restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every\u000aprotection. I must see Lorry.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They\u000aboth knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring\u000aaway with their dread loads over the hushing snow.\u000a\u000a\u201cI must see Lorry,\u201d the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.\u000a\u000aThe staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He\u000aand his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated\u000aand made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No\u000abetter man living to hold fast by what Tellson\u2019s had in keeping, and to\u000ahold his peace.\u000a\u000aA murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted\u000athe approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at the\u000aBank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and\u000adeserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters:\u000aNational Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality,\u000aFraternity, or Death!\u000a\u000aWho could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon the\u000achair--who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did he come out,\u000aagitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms? To whom did\u000ahe appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and\u000aturning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued,\u000ahe said: \u201cRemoved to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVI. Triumph\u000a\u000a\u000aThe dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined\u000aJury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were\u000aread out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The\u000astandard gaoler-joke was, \u201cCome out and listen to the Evening Paper, you\u000ainside there!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCharles Evremonde, called Darnay!\u201d\u000a\u000aSo at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.\u000a\u000aWhen a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved\u000afor those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles\u000aEvremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen\u000ahundreds pass away so.\u000a\u000aHis bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them\u000ato assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the\u000alist, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three\u000anames, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so\u000asummoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been\u000aguillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber\u000awhere Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his\u000aarrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human\u000acreature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the\u000ascaffold.\u000a\u000aThere were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was\u000asoon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force\u000awere engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little\u000aconcert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears\u000athere; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be\u000arefilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the\u000acommon rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs\u000awho kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from\u000ainsensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the\u000atime. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour\u000aor intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to\u000abrave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere\u000aboastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In\u000aseasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the\u000adisease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have\u000alike wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke\u000athem.\u000a\u000aThe passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its\u000avermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were\u000aput to the bar before Charles Darnay\u2019s name was called. All the fifteen\u000awere condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.\u000a\u000a\u201cCharles Evremonde, called Darnay,\u201d was at length arraigned.\u000a\u000aHis judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap\u000aand tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking\u000aat the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the\u000ausual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the\u000ahonest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never\u000awithout its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing\u000aspirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,\u000aanticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,\u000athe greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore\u000aknives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many\u000aknitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under\u000aher arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom\u000ahe had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly\u000aremembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in\u000ahis ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed\u000ain the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to\u000ahimself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to\u000abe waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at\u000athe Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,\u000ain his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.\u000aLorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who\u000awore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the\u000aCarmagnole.\u000a\u000aCharles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor\u000aas an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree\u000awhich banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the\u000adecree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and there was\u000athe decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.\u000a\u000a\u201cTake off his head!\u201d cried the audience. \u201cAn enemy to the Republic!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the\u000aprisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in\u000aEngland?\u000a\u000aUndoubtedly it was.\u000a\u000aWas he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?\u000a\u000aNot an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.\u000a\u000aWhy not? the President desired to know.\u000a\u000aBecause he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful\u000ato him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left\u000ahis country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present\u000aacceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in\u000aEngland, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.\u000a\u000aWhat proof had he of this?\u000a\u000aHe handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and\u000aAlexandre Manette.\u000a\u000aBut he had married in England? the President reminded him.\u000a\u000aTrue, but not an English woman.\u000a\u000aA citizeness of France?\u000a\u000aYes. By birth.\u000a\u000aHer name and family?\u000a\u000a\u201cLucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who\u000asits there.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation\u000aof the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were\u000athe people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious\u000acountenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as\u000aif with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.\u000a\u000aOn these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot\u000aaccording to Doctor Manette\u2019s reiterated instructions. The same cautious\u000acounsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every\u000ainch of his road.\u000a\u000aThe President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not\u000asooner?\u000a\u000aHe had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means\u000aof living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England,\u000ahe lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.\u000aHe had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of\u000aa French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his\u000aabsence. He had come back, to save a citizen\u2019s life, and to bear his\u000atestimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal\u000ain the eyes of the Republic?\u000a\u000aThe populace cried enthusiastically, \u201cNo!\u201d and the President rang his\u000abell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry \u201cNo!\u201d\u000a until they left off, of their own will.\u000a\u000aThe President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained\u000athat the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence\u000ato the citizen\u2019s letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier,\u000abut which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before\u000athe President.\u000a\u000aThe Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that\u000ait would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced\u000aand read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen\u000aGabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the\u000apressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of\u000aenemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly\u000aoverlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out\u000aof the Tribunal\u2019s patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he\u000ahad been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury\u2019s\u000adeclaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was\u000aanswered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde,\u000acalled Darnay.\u000a\u000aDoctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,\u000aand the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he\u000aproceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his\u000arelease from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in\u000aEngland, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in\u000atheir exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat\u000agovernment there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as\u000athe foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these\u000acircumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the\u000astraightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the\u000apopulace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur\u000aLorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,\u000ahad been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his\u000aaccount of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that\u000athey were ready with their votes if the President were content to\u000areceive them.\u000a\u000aAt every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace\u000aset up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner\u2019s\u000afavour, and the President declared him free.\u000a\u000aThen, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace\u000asometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards\u000agenerosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against\u000atheir swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of\u000athese motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,\u000ato a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner\u000awas the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood\u000aat another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the\u000aprisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after\u000ahis long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from\u000aexhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same\u000apeople, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with\u000athe very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the\u000astreets.\u000a\u000aHis removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,\u000arescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried\u000atogether, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not\u000aassisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate\u000aitself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to\u000ahim before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four\u000ahours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign\u000aof Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, \u201cLong live the\u000aRepublic!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,\u000afor when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great\u000acrowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in\u000aCourt--except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the\u000aconcourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by\u000aturns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of\u000awhich the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the\u000ashore.\u000a\u000aThey put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had\u000ataken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.\u000aOver the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they\u000ahad bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not\u000aeven the Doctor\u2019s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home\u000aon men\u2019s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him,\u000aand casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that\u000ahe more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he\u000awas in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.\u000a\u000aIn wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing\u000ahim out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the\u000aprevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as\u000athey had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried\u000ahim thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father\u000ahad gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his\u000afeet, she dropped insensible in his arms.\u000a\u000aAs he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his\u000aface and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come\u000atogether unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the\u000arest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.\u000aThen, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the\u000acrowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and\u000aoverflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river\u2019s bank,\u000aand over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled\u000athem away.\u000a\u000aAfter grasping the Doctor\u2019s hand, as he stood victorious and proud\u000abefore him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in\u000abreathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;\u000aafter kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round\u000ahis neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who\u000alifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their\u000arooms.\u000a\u000a\u201cLucie! My own! I am safe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cO dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have\u000aprayed to Him.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again in\u000ahis arms, he said to her:\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France\u000acould have done what he has done for me.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe laid her head upon her father\u2019s breast, as she had laid his poor\u000ahead on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return he\u000ahad made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his\u000astrength. \u201cYou must not be weak, my darling,\u201d he remonstrated; \u201cdon\u2019t\u000atremble so. I have saved him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVII. A Knock at the Door\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cI have saved him.\u201d It was not another of the dreams in which he had\u000aoften come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a\u000avague but heavy fear was upon her.\u000a\u000aAll the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately\u000arevengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on\u000avague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that\u000amany as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to\u000aher, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her\u000aheart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.\u000aThe shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now\u000athe dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued\u000athem, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to\u000ahis real presence and trembled more.\u000a\u000aHer father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this\u000awoman\u2019s weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking,\u000ano One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task\u000ahe had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let\u000athem all lean upon him.\u000a\u000aTheir housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was\u000athe safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but\u000abecause they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,\u000ahad had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards\u000athe living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and\u000apartly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and\u000acitizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them\u000aoccasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by\u000aMr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every\u000anight.\u000a\u000aIt was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,\u000aEquality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every\u000ahouse, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters\u000aof a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.\u000aJerry Cruncher\u2019s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down\u000abelow; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name\u000ahimself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had\u000aemployed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called\u000aDarnay.\u000a\u000aIn the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual\u000aharmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor\u2019s little household, as\u000ain very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted\u000awere purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small\u000ashops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as\u000apossible for talk and envy, was the general desire.\u000a\u000aFor some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the\u000aoffice of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the\u000abasket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were\u000alighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home\u000asuch purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long\u000aassociation with a French family, might have known as much of their\u000alanguage as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that\u000adirection; consequently she knew no more of that \u201cnonsense\u201d (as she was\u000apleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing\u000awas to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any\u000aintroduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be\u000athe name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold\u000aof it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always\u000amade a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,\u000aone finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, Mr. Cruncher,\u201d said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;\u000a\u201cif you are ready, I am.\u201d\u000a\u000aJerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross\u2019s service. He had worn\u000aall his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s all manner of things wanted,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cand we shall\u000ahave a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice toasts\u000athese Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,\u201d\u000a retorted Jerry, \u201cwhether they drink your health or the Old Un\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d said Miss Pross.\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning \u201cOld\u000aNick\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHa!\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cit doesn\u2019t need an interpreter to explain the\u000ameaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it\u2019s Midnight Murder,\u000aand Mischief.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!\u201d cried Lucie.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, yes, yes, I\u2019ll be cautious,\u201d said Miss Pross; \u201cbut I may say\u000aamong ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey\u000asmotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the\u000astreets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!\u000aTake care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don\u2019t move your\u000apretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!\u000aMay I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think you may take that liberty,\u201d the Doctor answered, smiling.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor gracious sake, don\u2019t talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of\u000athat,\u201d said Miss Pross.\u000a\u000a\u201cHush, dear! Again?\u201d Lucie remonstrated.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, my sweet,\u201d said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, \u201cthe\u000ashort and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious\u000aMajesty King George the Third;\u201d Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; \u201cand\u000aas such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish\u000atricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words\u000aafter Miss Pross, like somebody at church.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you\u000ahad never taken that cold in your voice,\u201d said Miss Pross, approvingly.\u000a\u201cBut the question, Doctor Manette. Is there\u201d--it was the good creature\u2019s\u000away to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety\u000awith them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--\u201cis there any\u000aprospect yet, of our getting out of this place?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHeigh-ho-hum!\u201d said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she\u000aglanced at her darling\u2019s golden hair in the light of the fire, \u201cthen we\u000amust have patience and wait: that\u2019s all. We must hold up our heads and\u000afight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don\u2019t\u000ayou move, Ladybird!\u201d\u000a\u000aThey went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the\u000achild, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the\u000aBanking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in\u000aa corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie\u000asat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,\u000ain a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of\u000aa great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out\u000aa captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and\u000aquiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she cried, all at once.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy dear!\u201d said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand\u000aon hers, \u201ccommand yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The\u000aleast thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your father\u2019s daughter!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought, my father,\u201d said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face\u000aand in a faltering voice, \u201cthat I heard strange feet upon the stairs.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy love, the staircase is as still as Death.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy child,\u201d said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her\u000ashoulder, \u201cI _have_ saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go\u000ato the door.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms,\u000aand opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough\u000amen in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay,\u201d said the first.\u000a\u000a\u201cWho seeks him?\u201d answered Darnay.\u000a\u000a\u201cI seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the\u000aTribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging\u000ato him.\u000a\u000a\u201cTell me how and why am I again a prisoner?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will\u000aknow to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow.\u201d\u000a\u000aDoctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he\u000astood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it,\u000amoved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting\u000athe speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red\u000awoollen shirt, said:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know him, you have said. Do you know me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe all know you, Citizen Doctor,\u201d said the other three.\u000a\u000aHe looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice,\u000aafter a pause:\u000a\u000a\u201cWill you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCitizen Doctor,\u201d said the first, reluctantly, \u201che has been denounced to\u000athe Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,\u201d pointing out the second who\u000ahad entered, \u201cis from Saint Antoine.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is accused by Saint Antoine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOf what?\u201d asked the Doctor.\u000a\u000a\u201cCitizen Doctor,\u201d said the first, with his former reluctance, \u201cask no\u000amore. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as\u000aa good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all.\u000aThe People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne word,\u201d the Doctor entreated. \u201cWill you tell me who denounced him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is against rule,\u201d answered the first; \u201cbut you can ask Him of Saint\u000aAntoine here.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his\u000afeet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:\u000a\u000a\u201cWell! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced--and gravely--by\u000athe Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat other?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen,\u201d said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, \u201cyou will be\u000aanswered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVIII. A Hand at Cards\u000a\u000a\u000aHappily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her\u000away along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the\u000aPont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases\u000ashe had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They\u000aboth looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they\u000apassed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and\u000aturned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It\u000awas a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing\u000alights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were\u000astationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the\u000aRepublic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got\u000aundeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never\u000agrown, for the National Razor shaved him close.\u000a\u000aHaving purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil\u000afor the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.\u000aAfter peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the\u000aGood Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,\u000aonce (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather\u000atook her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same\u000adescription they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was\u000anot so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her\u000aopinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,\u000aattended by her cavalier.\u000a\u000aSlightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,\u000aplaying with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,\u000abare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of\u000athe others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be\u000aresumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the\u000apopular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,\u000alike slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached\u000athe counter, and showed what they wanted.\u000a\u000aAs their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a\u000acorner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No\u000asooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped\u000aher hands.\u000a\u000aIn a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was\u000aassassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the\u000alikeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only\u000asaw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all\u000athe outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman,\u000aevidently English.\u000a\u000aWhat was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the\u000aGood Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very\u000avoluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss\u000aPross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no\u000aears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that\u000anot only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,\u000aMr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual\u000aaccount--was in a state of the greatest wonder.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;\u000aspeaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in\u000aEnglish.\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, Solomon, dear Solomon!\u201d cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again.\u000a\u201cAfter not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,\u000ado I find you here!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?\u201d asked the\u000aman, in a furtive, frightened way.\u000a\u000a\u201cBrother, brother!\u201d cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. \u201cHave I ever\u000abeen so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen hold your meddlesome tongue,\u201d said Solomon, \u201cand come out, if you\u000awant to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who\u2019s this man?\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means\u000aaffectionate brother, said through her tears, \u201cMr. Cruncher.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet him come out too,\u201d said Solomon. \u201cDoes he think me a ghost?\u201d\u000a\u000aApparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a\u000aword, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule\u000athrough her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did\u000aso, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus\u000aof Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French\u000alanguage, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and\u000apursuits.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow,\u201d said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, \u201cwhat do you\u000awant?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away\u000afrom!\u201d cried Miss Pross, \u201cto give me such a greeting, and show me no\u000aaffection.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere. Confound it! There,\u201d said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross\u2019s\u000alips with his own. \u201cNow are you content?\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you expect me to be surprised,\u201d said her brother Solomon, \u201cI am not\u000asurprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If\u000ayou really don\u2019t want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you\u000ado--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I\u000aam an official.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy English brother Solomon,\u201d mourned Miss Pross, casting up her\u000atear-fraught eyes, \u201cthat had the makings in him of one of the best and\u000agreatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and\u000asuch foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in\u000ahis--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI said so!\u201d cried her brother, interrupting. \u201cI knew it. You want to be\u000athe death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just\u000aas I am getting on!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!\u201d cried Miss Pross. \u201cFar\u000arather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever\u000aloved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,\u000aand tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will\u000adetain you no longer.\u201d\u000a\u000aGood Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any\u000aculpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years\u000aago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent\u000aher money and left her!\u000a\u000aHe was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging\u000acondescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative\u000amerits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,\u000aall the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder,\u000ahoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular\u000aquestion:\u000a\u000a\u201cI say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,\u000aor Solomon John?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not\u000apreviously uttered a word.\u000a\u000a\u201cCome!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher. \u201cSpeak out, you know.\u201d (Which, by the way,\u000awas more than he could do himself.) \u201cJohn Solomon, or Solomon John? She\u000acalls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know\u000ayou\u2019re John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that\u000aname of Pross, likewise. That warn\u2019t your name over the water.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know all I mean, for I can\u2019t call to mind what your name\u000awas, over the water.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo. But I\u2019ll swear it was a name of two syllables.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIndeed?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes. T\u2019other one\u2019s was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness\u000aat the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to\u000ayourself, was you called at that time?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBarsad,\u201d said another voice, striking in.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s the name for a thousand pound!\u201d cried Jerry.\u000a\u000aThe speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind\u000ahim under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher\u2019s\u000aelbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry\u2019s, to his\u000asurprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself\u000aelsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present\u000amyself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a\u000abetter employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad\u000awas not a Sheep of the Prisons.\u201d\u000a\u000aSheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy,\u000awho was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ll tell you,\u201d said Sydney. \u201cI lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out\u000aof the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls,\u000aan hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember\u000afaces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having\u000aa reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with\u000athe misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your\u000adirection. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and\u000asat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved\u000aconversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the\u000anature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed\u000ato shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat purpose?\u201d the spy asked.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the\u000astreet. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your\u000acompany--at the office of Tellson\u2019s Bank, for instance?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUnder a threat?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! Did I say that?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThen, why should I go there?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cReally, Mr. Barsad, I can\u2019t say, if you can\u2019t.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you mean that you won\u2019t say, sir?\u201d the spy irresolutely asked.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won\u2019t.\u201d\u000a\u000aCarton\u2019s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his\u000aquickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,\u000aand with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and\u000amade the most of it.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, I told you so,\u201d said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his\u000asister; \u201cif any trouble comes of this, it\u2019s your doing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCome, come, Mr. Barsad!\u201d exclaimed Sydney. \u201cDon\u2019t be ungrateful.\u000aBut for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so\u000apleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual\u000asatisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her\u000aown street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city,\u000aat this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort\u000aknows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry\u2019s with us. Are we\u000aready? Come then!\u201d\u000a\u000aMiss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life\u000aremembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney\u2019s arm and looked up\u000ain his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced\u000apurpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only\u000acontradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was\u000atoo much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved\u000aher affection, and with Sydney\u2019s friendly reassurances, adequately to\u000aheed what she observed.\u000a\u000aThey left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.\u000aLorry\u2019s, which was within a few minutes\u2019 walk. John Barsad, or Solomon\u000aPross, walked at his side.\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery\u000alittle log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the\u000apicture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson\u2019s, who had looked\u000ainto the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years\u000aago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with\u000awhich he saw a stranger.\u000a\u000a\u201cMiss Pross\u2019s brother, sir,\u201d said Sydney. \u201cMr. Barsad.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBarsad?\u201d repeated the old gentleman, \u201cBarsad? I have an association\u000awith the name--and with the face.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,\u201d observed Carton,\u000acoolly. \u201cPray sit down.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,\u000aby saying to him with a frown, \u201cWitness at that trial.\u201d Mr. Lorry\u000aimmediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised\u000alook of abhorrence.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate\u000abrother you have heard of,\u201d said Sydney, \u201cand has acknowledged the\u000arelationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.\u201d\u000a\u000aStruck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, \u201cWhat do you\u000atell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about\u000ato return to him!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cArrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJust now, if at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,\u201d said Sydney, \u201cand I\u000ahave it from Mr. Barsad\u2019s communication to a friend and brother Sheep\u000aover a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the\u000amessengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no\u000aearthly doubt that he is retaken.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry\u2019s business eye read in the speaker\u2019s face that it was loss\u000aof time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something\u000amight depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was\u000asilently attentive.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, I trust,\u201d said Sydney to him, \u201cthat the name and influence of\u000aDoctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he\u000awould be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes; I believe so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own\u000ato you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette\u2019s not having had the\u000apower to prevent this arrest.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe may not have known of it beforehand,\u201d said Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how\u000aidentified he is with his son-in-law.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his\u000achin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn short,\u201d said Sydney, \u201cthis is a desperate time, when desperate games\u000aare played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I\u000awill play the losing one. No man\u2019s life here is worth purchase. Any one\u000acarried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the\u000astake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend\u000ain the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.\u000aBarsad.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou need have good cards, sir,\u201d said the spy.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ll run them over. I\u2019ll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a\u000abrute I am; I wish you\u2019d give me a little brandy.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another\u000aglassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Barsad,\u201d he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking\u000aover a hand at cards: \u201cSheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican\u000acommittees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,\u000aso much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman\u000ais less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a\u000aFrenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.\u000aThat\u2019s a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican\u000aFrench government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic\u000aEnglish government, the enemy of France and freedom. That\u2019s an excellent\u000acard. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.\u000aBarsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the\u000aspy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,\u000athe English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so\u000adifficult to find. That\u2019s a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my\u000ahand, Mr. Barsad?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot to understand your play,\u201d returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.\u000a\u000a\u201cI play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section\u000aCommittee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don\u2019t\u000ahurry.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and\u000adrank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself\u000ainto a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he\u000apoured out and drank another glassful.\u000a\u000a\u201cLook over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards\u000ain it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable\u000aemployment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing\u000athere--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for\u000avaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern\u000adate--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in\u000aFrance: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen\u000athere: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He\u000aknew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint\u000aAntoine and Defarge\u2019s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police\u000asuch heads of information concerning Doctor Manette\u2019s imprisonment,\u000arelease, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to\u000afamiliar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame\u000aDefarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered\u000awith fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he\u000atalked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.\u000aHe had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over\u000aagain produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the\u000aguillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as\u000ahe was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that\u000ahe was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of\u000ahis utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning\u000aterror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such\u000agrave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw\u000athat the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many\u000aproofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash\u000ahis last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon\u000aterrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify\u000athe holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou scarcely seem to like your hand,\u201d said Sydney, with the greatest\u000acomposure. \u201cDo you play?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think, sir,\u201d said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr.\u000aLorry, \u201cI may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to\u000aput it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can\u000aunder any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace\u000aof which he has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is\u000aconsidered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by\u000asomebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean\u000ahimself as to make himself one?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,\u201d said Carton, taking the answer on himself,\u000aand looking at his watch, \u201cwithout any scruple, in a very few minutes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI should have hoped, gentlemen both,\u201d said the spy, always striving to\u000ahook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, \u201cthat your respect for my sister--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally\u000arelieving her of her brother,\u201d said Sydney Carton.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou think not, sir?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have thoroughly made up my mind about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his\u000aostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour,\u000areceived such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a\u000amystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and\u000afailed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air\u000aof contemplating cards:\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I\u000ahave another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and\u000afellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;\u000awho was he?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFrench. You don\u2019t know him,\u201d said the spy, quickly.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrench, eh?\u201d repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him\u000aat all, though he echoed his word. \u201cWell; he may be.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIs, I assure you,\u201d said the spy; \u201cthough it\u2019s not important.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThough it\u2019s not important,\u201d repeated Carton, in the same mechanical\u000away--\u201cthough it\u2019s not important--No, it\u2019s not important. No. Yet I know\u000athe face.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think not. I am sure not. It can\u2019t be,\u201d said the spy.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt-can\u2019t-be,\u201d muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his\u000aglass (which fortunately was a small one) again. \u201cCan\u2019t-be. Spoke good\u000aFrench. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cProvincial,\u201d said the spy.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo. Foreign!\u201d cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a\u000alight broke clearly on his mind. \u201cCly! Disguised, but the same man. We\u000ahad that man before us at the Old Bailey.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, there you are hasty, sir,\u201d said Barsad, with a smile that gave his\u000aaquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; \u201cthere you really give\u000ame an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this\u000adistance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I\u000aattended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church\u000aof Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard\u000amultitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped\u000ato lay him in his coffin.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable\u000agoblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it\u000ato be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the\u000arisen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher\u2019s head.\u000a\u000a\u201cLet us be reasonable,\u201d said the spy, \u201cand let us be fair. To show you\u000ahow mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will\u000alay before you a certificate of Cly\u2019s burial, which I happened to have\u000acarried in my pocket-book,\u201d with a hurried hand he produced and opened\u000ait, \u201cever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take\u000ait in your hand; it\u2019s no forgery.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and\u000aMr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more\u000aviolently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the\u000acrumpled horn in the house that Jack built.\u000a\u000aUnseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on\u000athe shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat there Roger Cly, master,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and\u000airon-bound visage. \u201cSo _you_ put him in his coffin?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWho took him out of it?\u201d\u000a\u000aBarsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI mean,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, \u201cthat he warn\u2019t never in it. No! Not he!\u000aI\u2019ll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in\u000aunspeakable astonishment at Jerry.\u000a\u000a\u201cI tell you,\u201d said Jerry, \u201cthat you buried paving-stones and earth in\u000athat there coffin. Don\u2019t go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a\u000atake in. Me and two more knows it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow do you know it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s that to you? Ecod!\u201d growled Mr. Cruncher, \u201cit\u2019s you I have got a\u000aold grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!\u000aI\u2019d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.\u201d\u000a\u000aSydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at\u000athis turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and\u000aexplain himself.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt another time, sir,\u201d he returned, evasively, \u201cthe present time is\u000aill-conwenient for explainin\u2019. What I stand to, is, that he knows well\u000awot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was,\u000ain so much as a word of one syllable, and I\u2019ll either catch hold of his\u000athroat and choke him for half a guinea;\u201d Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as\u000aquite a liberal offer; \u201cor I\u2019ll out and announce him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHumph! I see one thing,\u201d said Carton. \u201cI hold another card, Mr. Barsad.\u000aImpossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for\u000ayou to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another\u000aaristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has\u000athe mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!\u000aA plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong\u000acard--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo!\u201d returned the spy. \u201cI throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular\u000awith the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk\u000aof being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that\u000ahe never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this\u000aman knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNever you trouble your head about this man,\u201d retorted the contentious\u000aMr. Cruncher; \u201cyou\u2019ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to\u000athat gentleman. And look here! Once more!\u201d--Mr. Cruncher could not\u000abe restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his\u000aliberality--\u201cI\u2019d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a\u000aguinea.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said,\u000awith more decision, \u201cIt has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and\u000acan\u2019t overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?\u000aNow, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my\u000aoffice, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my\u000alife to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,\u000aI should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate\u000ahere. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my\u000away through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with\u000ame?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,\u201d\u000a said the spy, firmly.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at the\u000aConciergerie?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sometimes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can be when you choose?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can pass in and out when I choose.\u201d\u000a\u000aSydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out\u000aupon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he\u000asaid, rising:\u000a\u000a\u201cSo far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that\u000athe merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come\u000ainto the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIX. The Game Made\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining\u000adark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked\u000aat Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman\u2019s\u000amanner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the\u000aleg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs,\u000aand were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very\u000aquestionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry\u2019s eye caught\u000ahis, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the\u000ahollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an\u000ainfirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.\u000a\u000a\u201cJerry,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cCome here.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance\u000aof him.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat have you been, besides a messenger?\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron,\u000aMr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, \u201cAgicultooral\u000acharacter.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy mind misgives me much,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger\u000aat him, \u201cthat you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson\u2019s\u000aas a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous\u000adescription. If you have, don\u2019t expect me to befriend you when you\u000aget back to England. If you have, don\u2019t expect me to keep your secret.\u000aTellson\u2019s shall not be imposed upon.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope, sir,\u201d pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, \u201cthat a gentleman like\u000ayourself wot I\u2019ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I\u2019m grey at it,\u000awould think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don\u2019t say it\u000ais, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if\u000ait wos, it wouldn\u2019t, even then, be all o\u2019 one side. There\u2019d be two sides\u000ato it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking\u000aup their guineas where a honest tradesman don\u2019t pick up his\u000afardens--fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no, nor\u000ayet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson\u2019s, and a cocking\u000atheir medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going\u000aout to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so.\u000aWell, that \u2018ud be imposing, too, on Tellson\u2019s. For you cannot sarse the\u000agoose and not the gander. And here\u2019s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos\u000ain the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,\u000aa floppin\u2019 again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark\u000aruinating! Whereas them medical doctors\u2019 wives don\u2019t flop--catch \u2018em at\u000ait! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,\u000aand how can you rightly have one without t\u2019other? Then, wot with\u000aundertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot\u000awith private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn\u2019t get\u000amuch by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never\u000aprosper with him, Mr. Lorry. He\u2019d never have no good of it; he\u2019d want\u000aall along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being\u000aonce in--even if it wos so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUgh!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, \u201cI am shocked at\u000athe sight of you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,\u201d pursued Mr. Cruncher,\u000a\u201ceven if it wos so, which I don\u2019t say it is--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t prevaricate,\u201d said Mr. Lorry.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I will _not_, sir,\u201d returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were\u000afurther from his thoughts or practice--\u201cwhich I don\u2019t say it is--wot I\u000awould humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at\u000athat there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to\u000abe a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till\u000ayour heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it\u000awos so, which I still don\u2019t say it is (for I will not prewaricate to\u000ayou, sir), let that there boy keep his father\u2019s place, and take care of\u000ahis mother; don\u2019t blow upon that boy\u2019s father--do not do it, sir--and\u000alet that father go into the line of the reg\u2019lar diggin\u2019, and make amends\u000afor what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin\u2019 of \u2018em in with\u000aa will, and with conwictions respectin\u2019 the futur\u2019 keepin\u2019 of \u2018em safe.\u000aThat, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his\u000aarm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his\u000adiscourse, \u201cis wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don\u2019t\u000asee all this here a goin\u2019 on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects\u000awithout heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down\u000ato porterage and hardly that, without havin\u2019 his serious thoughts of\u000athings. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin\u2019 of you\u000afur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good\u000acause when I might have kep\u2019 it back.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat at least is true,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cSay no more now. It may be\u000athat I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in\u000aaction--not in words. I want no more words.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy\u000areturned from the dark room. \u201cAdieu, Mr. Barsad,\u201d said the former; \u201cour\u000aarrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they\u000awere alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?\u000a\u000a\u201cNot much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access\u000ato him, once.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry\u2019s countenance fell.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is all I could do,\u201d said Carton. \u201cTo propose too much, would be\u000ato put this man\u2019s head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing\u000aworse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the\u000aweakness of the position. There is no help for it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut access to him,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cif it should go ill before the\u000aTribunal, will not save him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI never said it would.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry\u2019s eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his\u000adarling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually\u000aweakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,\u000aand his tears fell.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are a good man and a true friend,\u201d said Carton, in an altered\u000avoice. \u201cForgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my\u000afather weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your\u000asorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,\u000ahowever.\u201d\u000a\u000aThough he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there\u000awas a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,\u000athat Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly\u000aunprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo return to poor Darnay,\u201d said Carton. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Her of this\u000ainterview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see\u000ahim. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey\u000ato him the means of anticipating the sentence.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to\u000asee if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and\u000aevidently understood it.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe might think a thousand things,\u201d Carton said, \u201cand any of them would\u000aonly add to her trouble. Don\u2019t speak of me to her. As I said to you when\u000aI first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any\u000alittle helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.\u000aYou are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am going now, directly.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance\u000aon you. How does she look?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAh!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. It\u000aattracted Mr. Lorry\u2019s eyes to Carton\u2019s face, which was turned to the\u000afire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),\u000apassed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a\u000awild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little\u000aflaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat\u000aand top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their\u000alight surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,\u000aall untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was\u000asufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;\u000ahis boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had\u000abroken under the weight of his foot.\u000a\u000a\u201cI forgot it,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry\u2019s eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the\u000awasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having\u000athe expression of prisoners\u2019 faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly\u000areminded of that expression.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?\u201d said Carton, turning\u000ato him.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so\u000aunexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to\u000ahave left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have\u000amy Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey were both silent.\u000a\u000a\u201cYours is a long life to look back upon, sir?\u201d said Carton, wistfully.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am in my seventy-eighth year.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;\u000atrusted, respected, and looked up to?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I\u000amay say that I was a man of business when a boy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSee what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss\u000ayou when you leave it empty!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA solitary old bachelor,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. \u201cThere\u000ais nobody to weep for me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow can you say that? Wouldn\u2019t She weep for you? Wouldn\u2019t her child?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, yes, thank God. I didn\u2019t quite mean what I said.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSurely, surely.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,\u000a\u2018I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or\u000arespect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no\u000aregard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!\u2019\u000ayour seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they\u000anot?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.\u201d\u000a\u000aSydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a\u000afew moments, said:\u000a\u000a\u201cI should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the\u000adays when you sat at your mother\u2019s knee, seem days of very long ago?\u201d\u000a\u000aResponding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:\u000a\u000a\u201cTwenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw\u000acloser and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and\u000anearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and\u000apreparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances\u000athat had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!),\u000aand by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not\u000aso real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI understand the feeling!\u201d exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. \u201cAnd\u000ayou are the better for it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope so.\u201d\u000a\u000aCarton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with\u000ahis outer coat; \u201cBut you,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, \u201cyou\u000aare young.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d said Carton. \u201cI am not old, but my young way was never the way to\u000aage. Enough of me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd of me, I am sure,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cAre you going out?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless\u000ahabits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don\u2019t be\u000auneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, unhappily.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a\u000aplace for me. Take my arm, sir.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A\u000afew minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry\u2019s destination. Carton left him\u000athere; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate\u000aagain when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to\u000athe prison every day. \u201cShe came out here,\u201d he said, looking about him,\u000a\u201cturned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in\u000aher steps.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was ten o\u2019clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force,\u000awhere she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having\u000aclosed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood night, citizen,\u201d said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the\u000aman eyed him inquisitively.\u000a\u000a\u201cGood night, citizen.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow goes the Republic?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount\u000ato a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being\u000aexhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you often go to see him--\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNever.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGo and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,\u000acitizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less\u000athan two pipes. Word of honour!\u201d\u000a\u000aAs the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain\u000ahow he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire\u000ato strike the life out of him, that he turned away.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut you are not English,\u201d said the wood-sawyer, \u201cthough you wear\u000aEnglish dress?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou speak like a Frenchman.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am an old student here.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood night, citizen.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBut go and see that droll dog,\u201d the little man persisted, calling after\u000ahim. \u201cAnd take a pipe with you!\u201d\u000a\u000aSydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of\u000athe street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap\u000aof paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered\u000athe way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,\u000afor the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of\u000aterror--he stopped at a chemist\u2019s shop, which the owner was closing with\u000ahis own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill\u000athoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.\u000a\u000aGiving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his\u000acounter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. \u201cWhew!\u201d the chemist\u000awhistled softly, as he read it. \u201cHi! hi! hi!\u201d\u000a\u000aSydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:\u000a\u000a\u201cFor you, citizen?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFor me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the\u000aconsequences of mixing them?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerfectly.\u201d\u000a\u000aCertain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by\u000aone, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them,\u000aand deliberately left the shop. \u201cThere is nothing more to do,\u201d said he,\u000aglancing upward at the moon, \u201cuntil to-morrow. I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words\u000aaloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of\u000anegligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who\u000ahad wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into\u000ahis road and saw its end.\u000a\u000aLong ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a\u000ayouth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His\u000amother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been\u000aread at his father\u2019s grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark\u000astreets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing\u000aon high above him. \u201cI am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:\u000ahe that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and\u000awhosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow\u000arising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,\u000aand for to-morrow\u2019s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,\u000aand still of to-morrow\u2019s and to-morrow\u2019s, the chain of association that\u000abrought the words home, like a rusty old ship\u2019s anchor from the deep,\u000amight have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and\u000awent on.\u000a\u000aWith a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were\u000agoing to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors\u000asurrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers\u000awere said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length\u000aof self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and\u000aprofligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon\u000athe gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets\u000aalong which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and\u000amaterial, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among\u000athe people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn\u000ainterest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its\u000ashort nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for\u000athe lighter streets.\u000a\u000aFew coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be\u000asuspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy\u000ashoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the\u000apeople poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At\u000aone of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking\u000afor a way across the street through the mud. He carried the child over,\u000aand before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth\u000ain me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and\u000abelieveth in me, shall never die.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words\u000awere in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm\u000aand steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he\u000aheard them always.\u000a\u000aThe night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the\u000awater as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the\u000apicturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light\u000aof the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the\u000asky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died,\u000aand for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to\u000aDeath\u2019s dominion.\u000a\u000aBut, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden\u000aof the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays.\u000aAnd looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light\u000aappeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river\u000asparkled under it.\u000a\u000aThe strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial\u000afriend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the\u000ahouses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the\u000abank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little\u000alonger, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the\u000astream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--\u201cLike me.\u201d\u000a\u000aA trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then\u000aglided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track\u000ain the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart\u000afor a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors,\u000aended in the words, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise\u000awhere the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a\u000alittle coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh\u000ahimself, went out to the place of trial.\u000a\u000aThe court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell\u000aaway from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.\u000aMr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there,\u000asitting beside her father.\u000a\u000aWhen her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so\u000asustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying\u000atenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy\u000ablood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If\u000athere had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney\u000aCarton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.\u000a\u000aBefore that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,\u000aensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have\u000abeen no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not\u000afirst been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the\u000aRevolution was to scatter them all to the winds.\u000a\u000aEvery eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good\u000arepublicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day\u000aafter. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and\u000ahis fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance\u000agave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,\u000acannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St.\u000aAntoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.\u000a\u000aEvery eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.\u000aNo favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,\u000amurderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye\u000ain the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one\u000aanother, before bending forward with a strained attention.\u000a\u000aCharles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused and\u000aretaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected and\u000aDenounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants,\u000aone of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished\u000aprivileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles Evremonde,\u000acalled Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.\u000a\u000aTo this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.\u000a\u000aThe President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?\u000a\u000a\u201cOpenly, President.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBy whom?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThree voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTherese Defarge, his wife.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAlexandre Manette, physician.\u201d\u000a\u000aA great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor\u000aManette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and\u000aa fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My\u000adaughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who\u000aand where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband\u000aof my child!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCitizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority of\u000athe Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is dearer\u000ato you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the\u000aRepublic.\u201d\u000a\u000aLoud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell, and\u000awith warmth resumed.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child\u000aherself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is\u000ato follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!\u201d\u000a\u000aFrantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with\u000ahis eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew\u000acloser to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together,\u000aand restored the usual hand to his mouth.\u000a\u000aDefarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his\u000abeing heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of\u000ahis having been a mere boy in the Doctor\u2019s service, and of the release,\u000aand of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him.\u000aThis short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe so.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: \u201cYou were one of the\u000abest patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day\u000athere, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when\u000ait fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience,\u000athus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but, The\u000aVengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, \u201cI defy that bell!\u201d\u000a wherein she was likewise much commended.\u000a\u000a\u201cInform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,\u000acitizen.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI knew,\u201d said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the\u000abottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him;\u000a\u201cI knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell\u000aknown as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself. He\u000aknew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower,\u000awhen he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day, I resolve,\u000awhen the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount to\u000athe cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a\u000agaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a\u000astone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is\u000athat written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens\u000aof the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette.\u000aI confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of\u000athe President.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet it be read.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking\u000alovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with\u000asolicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the\u000areader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge\u000anever taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there\u000aintent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as\u000afollows.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aX. The Substance of the Shadow\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cI, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and\u000aafterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful\u000acell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write\u000ait at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it\u000ain the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a\u000aplace of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I\u000aand my sorrows are dust.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with\u000adifficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed\u000awith blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope\u000ahas quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have\u000anoted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I\u000asolemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right\u000amind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the\u000atruth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they\u000abe ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.\u000a\u000a\u201cOne cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the\u000atwenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired\u000apart of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air,\u000aat an hour\u2019s distance from my place of residence in the Street of the\u000aSchool of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very\u000afast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it\u000amight otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a\u000avoice called to the driver to stop.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,\u000aand the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage\u000awas then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the\u000adoor and alight before I came up with it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to\u000aconceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,\u000aI also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather\u000ayounger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice,\u000aand (as far as I could see) face too.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018You are Doctor Manette?\u2019 said one.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,\u2019 said the other; \u2018the young\u000aphysician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two\u000ahas made a rising reputation in Paris?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Gentlemen,\u2019 I returned, \u2018I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so\u000agraciously.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018We have been to your residence,\u2019 said the first, \u2018and not being\u000aso fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were\u000aprobably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of\u000aovertaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThe manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words\u000awere spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.\u000aThey were armed. I was not.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Gentlemen,\u2019 said I, \u2018pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me\u000athe honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to\u000awhich I am summoned.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThe reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. \u2018Doctor,\u000ayour clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case,\u000aour confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for\u000ayourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to\u000aenter the carriage?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cI could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both\u000aentered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The\u000acarriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that\u000ait is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it took\u000aplace, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make\u000athe broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my\u000apaper in its hiding-place.\u000a\u000a        *****\u000a\u000a\u201cThe carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and\u000aemerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the\u000aBarrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards\u000awhen I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently\u000astopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by\u000aa damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had\u000aoverflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in\u000aanswer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck\u000athe man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention,\u000afor I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But, the\u000aother of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner\u000awith his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly\u000aalike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found\u000alocked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had\u000arelocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was\u000aconducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we\u000aascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,\u000alying on a bed.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much\u000apast twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to\u000aher sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were\u000aall portions of a gentleman\u2019s dress. On one of them, which was a fringed\u000ascarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble,\u000aand the letter E.\u000a\u000a\u201cI saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient;\u000afor, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the\u000aedge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was\u000ain danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve\u000aher breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the\u000acorner caught my sight.\u000a\u000a\u201cI turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her\u000aand keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated and\u000awild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the\u000awords, \u2018My husband, my father, and my brother!\u2019 and then counted up to\u000atwelve, and said, \u2018Hush!\u2019 For an instant, and no more, she would pause\u000ato listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she\u000awould repeat the cry, \u2018My husband, my father, and my brother!\u2019 and\u000awould count up to twelve, and say, \u2018Hush!\u2019 There was no variation in the\u000aorder, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment\u2019s\u000apause, in the utterance of these sounds.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018How long,\u2019 I asked, \u2018has this lasted?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cTo distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the\u000ayounger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority. It\u000awas the elder who replied, \u2018Since about this hour last night.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018She has a husband, a father, and a brother?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018A brother.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018I do not address her brother?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cHe answered with great contempt, \u2018No.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018She has some recent association with the number twelve?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThe younger brother impatiently rejoined, \u2018With twelve o\u2019clock?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018See, gentlemen,\u2019 said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, \u2018how\u000auseless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was coming\u000ato see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost. There\u000aare no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThe elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, \u2018There is\u000aa case of medicines here;\u2019 and brought it from a closet, and put it on\u000athe table.\u000a\u000a        *****\u000a\u000a\u201cI opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my\u000alips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were\u000apoisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Do you doubt them?\u2019 asked the younger brother.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,\u2019 I replied, and said no\u000amore.\u000a\u000a\u201cI made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many\u000aefforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it\u000aafter a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then\u000asat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman\u000ain attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into\u000aa corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently\u000afurnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick\u000aold hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the\u000asound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular\u000asuccession, with the cry, \u2018My husband, my father, and my brother!\u2019 the\u000acounting up to twelve, and \u2018Hush!\u2019 The frenzy was so violent, that I had\u000anot unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to\u000athem, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement\u000ain the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer\u2019s breast had this much\u000asoothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the\u000afigure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more\u000aregular.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by\u000athe side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,\u000abefore the elder said:\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018There is another patient.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cI was startled, and asked, \u2018Is it a pressing case?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018You had better see,\u2019 he carelessly answered; and took up a light.\u000a\u000a        *****\u000a\u000a\u201cThe other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which\u000awas a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling\u000ato a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and\u000athere were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of\u000athe place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to\u000apass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial\u000aand unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in\u000athis my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my\u000acaptivity, as I saw them all that night.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a\u000ahandsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most.\u000aHe lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his\u000abreast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see\u000awhere his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see\u000athat he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018I am a doctor, my poor fellow,\u2019 said I. \u2018Let me examine it.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018I do not want it examined,\u2019 he answered; \u2018let it be.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away.\u000aThe wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours\u000abefore, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to\u000awithout delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder\u000abrother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was\u000aebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all\u000aas if he were a fellow-creature.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018How has this been done, monsieur?\u2019 said I.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him,\u000aand has fallen by my brother\u2019s sword--like a gentleman.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this\u000aanswer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to\u000ahave that different order of creature dying there, and that it would\u000ahave been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his\u000avermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about\u000athe boy, or about his fate.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe boy\u2019s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now\u000aslowly moved to me.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are\u000aproud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but\u000awe have a little pride left, sometimes. She--have you seen her, Doctor?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThe shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the\u000adistance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.\u000a\u000a\u201cI said, \u2018I have seen her.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these\u000aNobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we\u000ahave had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say\u000aso. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a\u000atenant of his. We were all tenants of his--that man\u2019s who stands there.\u000aThe other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force\u000ato speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs\u000aare by those superior Beings--taxed by him without mercy, obliged to\u000awork for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged\u000ato feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden\u000afor our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and\u000aplundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we\u000aate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his\u000apeople should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed,\u000aand hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a\u000adreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should\u000amost pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable\u000arace die out!\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cI had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth\u000alike a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people\u000asomewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the\u000adying boy.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that time,\u000apoor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort\u000ahim in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it. She had not\u000abeen married many weeks, when that man\u2019s brother saw her and admired\u000aher, and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among\u000aus! He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and\u000ahated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine. What did the two\u000athen, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her\u000awilling?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThe boy\u2019s eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the\u000alooker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The two\u000aopposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this\u000aBastille; the gentleman\u2019s, all negligent indifference; the peasant\u2019s, all\u000atrodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to\u000aharness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him and\u000adrove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their\u000agrounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep\u000amay not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at\u000anight, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was\u000anot persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he\u000acould find food--he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the\u000abell, and died on her bosom.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to\u000atell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as\u000ahe forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his\u000awound.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Then, with that man\u2019s permission and even with his aid, his\u000abrother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his\u000abrother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if\u000ait is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion,\u000afor a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When I took the\u000atidings home, our father\u2019s heart burst; he never spoke one of the words\u000athat filled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place\u000abeyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be\u000a_his_ vassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed\u000ain--a common dog, but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window? It was\u000asomewhere here?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThe room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around\u000ahim. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled\u000aover the floor, as if there had been a struggle.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he was\u000adead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck\u000aat me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to\u000amake him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword\u000athat he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust\u000aat me with all his skill for his life.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cMy glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of\u000aa broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman\u2019s. In\u000aanother place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier\u2019s.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018He is not here,\u2019 I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he\u000areferred to the brother.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the\u000aman who was here? Turn my face to him.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cI did so, raising the boy\u2019s head against my knee. But, invested for the\u000amoment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging\u000ame to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Marquis,\u2019 said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and\u000ahis right hand raised, \u2018in the days when all these things are to be\u000aanswered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to\u000aanswer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that\u000aI do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for,\u000aI summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them\u000aseparately. I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do\u000ait.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cTwice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his\u000aforefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the\u000afinger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him\u000adown dead.\u000a\u000a        *****\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving\u000ain precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might last\u000afor many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the\u000agrave.\u000a\u000a\u201cI repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of\u000athe bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing\u000aquality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order\u000aof her words. They were always \u2018My husband, my father, and my brother!\u000aOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,\u000atwelve. Hush!\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThis lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I had\u000acome and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to\u000afalter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and\u000aby-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and\u000afearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to\u000acompose her figure and the dress she had torn. It was then that I knew\u000aher condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being\u000aa mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had\u000ahad of her.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Is she dead?\u2019 asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the\u000aelder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Not dead,\u2019 said I; \u2018but like to die.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018What strength there is in these common bodies!\u2019 he said, looking down\u000aat her with some curiosity.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018There is prodigious strength,\u2019 I answered him, \u2018in sorrow and\u000adespair.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cHe first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He moved a\u000achair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a\u000asubdued voice,\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I\u000arecommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high,\u000aand, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful\u000aof your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen,\u000aand not spoken of.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cI listened to the patient\u2019s breathing, and avoided answering.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Monsieur,\u2019 said I, \u2018in my profession, the communications of patients\u000aare always received in confidence.\u2019 I was guarded in my answer, for I\u000awas troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.\u000a\u000a\u201cHer breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the\u000apulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I\u000aresumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.\u000a\u000a        *****\u000a\u000a\u201cI write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so\u000afearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total\u000adarkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or\u000afailure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that\u000awas ever spoken between me and those brothers.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some few\u000asyllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She\u000aasked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It\u000awas in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her\u000ahead upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the\u000abrothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until\u000athen, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the\u000awoman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind\u000athe curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to\u000athat, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as\u000aif--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.\u000a\u000a\u201cI always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger\u000abrother\u2019s (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that\u000apeasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind\u000aof either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading\u000ato the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger\u000abrother\u2019s eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply,\u000afor knowing what I knew from the boy. He was smoother and more polite to\u000ame than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an incumbrance\u000ain the mind of the elder, too.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch,\u000aanswering almost to the minute when I had first seen her. I was alone\u000awith her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and\u000aall her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride\u000aaway. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with\u000atheir riding-whips, and loitering up and down.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018At last she is dead?\u2019 said the elder, when I went in.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018She is dead,\u2019 said I.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018I congratulate you, my brother,\u2019 were his words as he turned round.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He now\u000agave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it on\u000athe table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept\u000anothing.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Pray excuse me,\u2019 said I. \u2018Under the circumstances, no.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThey exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to\u000athem, and we parted without another word on either side.\u000a\u000a        *****\u000a\u000a\u201cI am weary, weary, weary--worn down by misery. I cannot read what I\u000ahave written with this gaunt hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cEarly in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a\u000alittle box, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had anxiously\u000aconsidered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately\u000ato the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been\u000asummoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the\u000acircumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities\u000aof the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be\u000aheard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a\u000aprofound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state\u000ain my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but\u000aI was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were\u000acompromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that\u000anight. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it.\u000aIt was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just\u000acompleted, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.\u000a\u000a        *****\u000a\u000a\u201cI am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is\u000aso cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so\u000adreadful.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long\u000alife. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the\u000awife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the\u000aboy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered\u000aon the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I\u000ahad seen that nobleman very lately.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our\u000aconversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I\u000aknow not at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected, and\u000ain part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband\u2019s\u000ashare in it, and my being resorted to. She did not know that the girl\u000awas dead. Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her,\u000ain secret, a woman\u2019s sympathy. Her hope had been to avert the wrath of\u000aHeaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and\u000aher greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her nothing\u000abut that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her\u000ainducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope\u000athat I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this\u000awretched hour I am ignorant of both.\u000a\u000a        *****\u000a\u000a\u201cThese scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning,\u000ayesterday. I must finish my record to-day.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How\u000acould she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence\u000awas all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her\u000ahusband too. When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a\u000apretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018For his sake, Doctor,\u2019 she said, pointing to him in tears, \u2018I would do\u000aall I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper in his\u000ainheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent\u000aatonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him. What\u000aI have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few\u000ajewels--I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the\u000acompassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if\u000athe sister can be discovered.\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cShe kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, \u2018It is for thine own dear\u000asake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?\u2019 The child answered her\u000abravely, \u2018Yes!\u2019 I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and\u000awent away caressing him. I never saw her more.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs she had mentioned her husband\u2019s name in the faith that I knew it,\u000aI added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not\u000atrusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat night, the last night of the year, towards nine o\u2019clock, a man in\u000aa black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed\u000amy servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant came\u000ainto the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart!\u000aMy fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at\u000athe gate, standing silent behind him.\u000a\u000a\u201cAn urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain me,\u000ahe had a coach in waiting.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the\u000ahouse, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and\u000amy arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark\u000acorner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis took from\u000ahis pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light\u000aof a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot.\u000aNot a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my living\u000agrave.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the\u000abrothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of\u000amy dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or\u000adead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But,\u000anow I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that\u000athey have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the\u000alast of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last\u000anight of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times\u000awhen all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven\u000aand to earth.\u201d\u000a\u000aA terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A\u000asound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but\u000ablood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time,\u000aand there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.\u000a\u000aLittle need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show\u000ahow the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured\u000aBastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their\u000atime. Little need to show that this detested family name had long been\u000aanathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register.\u000aThe man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have\u000asustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.\u000a\u000aAnd all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a\u000awell-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife. One\u000aof the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of\u000athe questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and\u000aself-immolations on the people\u2019s altar. Therefore when the President\u000asaid (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good\u000aphysician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by\u000arooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel\u000aa sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an\u000aorphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of\u000ahuman sympathy.\u000a\u000a\u201cMuch influence around him, has that Doctor?\u201d murmured Madame Defarge,\u000asmiling to The Vengeance. \u201cSave him now, my Doctor, save him!\u201d\u000a\u000aAt every juryman\u2019s vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar and\u000aroar.\u000a\u000aUnanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy\u000aof the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the\u000aConciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXI. Dusk\u000a\u000a\u000aThe wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under\u000athe sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no\u000asound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was\u000ashe of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment\u000ait, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.\u000a\u000aThe Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors,\u000athe Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the court\u2019s\u000aemptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood\u000astretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face\u000abut love and consolation.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens, if\u000ayou would have so much compassion for us!\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had\u000ataken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the\u000ashow in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, \u201cLet her embrace\u000ahim then; it is but a moment.\u201d It was silently acquiesced in, and they\u000apassed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by\u000aleaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.\u000a\u000a\u201cFarewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love. We\u000ashall meet again, where the weary are at rest!\u201d\u000a\u000aThey were her husband\u2019s words, as he held her to his bosom.\u000a\u000a\u201cI can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don\u2019t suffer\u000afor me. A parting blessing for our child.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her by\u000ayou.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy husband. No! A moment!\u201d He was tearing himself apart from her.\u000a\u201cWe shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart\u000aby-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God\u000awill raise up friends for her, as He did for me.\u201d\u000a\u000aHer father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both\u000aof them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel\u000ato us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know, now what\u000ayou underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We\u000aknow now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for\u000aher dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and\u000aduty. Heaven be with you!\u201d\u000a\u000aHer father\u2019s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair,\u000aand wring them with a shriek of anguish.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt could not be otherwise,\u201d said the prisoner. \u201cAll things have worked\u000atogether as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to\u000adischarge my poor mother\u2019s trust that first brought my fatal presence\u000anear you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in\u000anature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive me. Heaven\u000abless you!\u201d\u000a\u000aAs he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him\u000awith her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and\u000awith a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting\u000asmile. As he went out at the prisoners\u2019 door, she turned, laid her head\u000alovingly on her father\u2019s breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his\u000afeet.\u000a\u000aThen, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved,\u000aSydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were\u000awith her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.\u000aYet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a\u000aflush of pride in it.\u000a\u000a\u201cShall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a\u000acoach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat\u000abeside the driver.\u000a\u000aWhen they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not\u000amany hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of\u000athe street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up\u000athe staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch, where\u000aher child and Miss Pross wept over her.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t recall her to herself,\u201d he said, softly, to the latter, \u201cshe is\u000abetter so. Don\u2019t revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!\u201d cried little Lucie, springing up and\u000athrowing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. \u201cNow that\u000ayou have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to\u000asave papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who\u000alove her, bear to see her so?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He\u000aput her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.\u000a\u000a\u201cBefore I go,\u201d he said, and paused--\u201cI may kiss her?\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face\u000awith his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to\u000ahim, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a\u000ahandsome old lady, that she heard him say, \u201cA life you love.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry\u000aand her father, who were following, and said to the latter:\u000a\u000a\u201cYou had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least\u000abe tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to\u000ayou, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the\u000astrongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.\u201d He returned the\u000aanswer in great trouble, and very slowly.\u000a\u000a\u201cTry them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few\u000aand short, but try.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI intend to try. I will not rest a moment.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s well. I have known such energy as yours do great things before\u000anow--though never,\u201d he added, with a smile and a sigh together, \u201csuch\u000agreat things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse\u000ait, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it\u000awere not.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will go,\u201d said Doctor Manette, \u201cto the Prosecutor and the President\u000astraight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will\u000awrite too, and--But stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and no\u000aone will be accessible until dark.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the\u000aforlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you\u000aspeed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have seen\u000athese dread powers, Doctor Manette?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cImmediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from\u000athis.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I\u000ago to Mr. Lorry\u2019s at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from\u000aour friend or from yourself?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMay you prosper!\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the\u000ashoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have no hope,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.\u000a\u000a\u201cNor have I.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare\u000ahim--which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man\u2019s\u000ato them!--I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the\u000acourt.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t despond,\u201d said Carton, very gently; \u201cdon\u2019t grieve. I encouraged\u000aDoctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be\u000aconsolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think \u2018his life was wantonly\u000athrown away or wasted,\u2019 and that might trouble her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, \u201cyou are right.\u000aBut he will perish; there is no real hope.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes. He will perish: there is no real hope,\u201d echoed Carton.\u000a\u000aAnd walked with a settled step, down-stairs.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXII. Darkness\u000a\u000a\u000aSydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. \u201cAt\u000aTellson\u2019s banking-house at nine,\u201d he said, with a musing face. \u201cShall I\u000ado well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that\u000athese people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound\u000aprecaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care!\u000aLet me think it out!\u201d\u000a\u000aChecking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a\u000aturn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought\u000ain his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was\u000aconfirmed. \u201cIt is best,\u201d he said, finally resolved, \u201cthat these people\u000ashould know there is such a man as I here.\u201d And he turned his face\u000atowards Saint Antoine.\u000a\u000aDefarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in\u000athe Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city\u000awell, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained\u000aits situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined\u000aat a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the\u000afirst time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he\u000ahad taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had\u000adropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry\u2019s hearth like a man who had\u000adone with it.\u000a\u000aIt was as late as seven o\u2019clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out\u000ainto the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he\u000astopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered\u000athe disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and\u000ahis wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge\u2019s, and went in.\u000a\u000aThere happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the\u000arestless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon\u000athe Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the\u000aDefarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like\u000aa regular member of the establishment.\u000a\u000aAs Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent\u000aFrench) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless\u000aglance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced\u000ato him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.\u000a\u000aHe repeated what he had already said.\u000a\u000a\u201cEnglish?\u201d asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark\u000aeyebrows.\u000a\u000aAfter looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were\u000aslow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign\u000aaccent. \u201cYes, madame, yes. I am English!\u201d\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he\u000atook up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its\u000ameaning, he heard her say, \u201cI swear to you, like Evremonde!\u201d\u000a\u000aDefarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGood evening.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh! Good evening, citizen,\u201d filling his glass. \u201cAh! and good wine. I\u000adrink to the Republic.\u201d\u000a\u000aDefarge went back to the counter, and said, \u201cCertainly, a little like.\u201d\u000a Madame sternly retorted, \u201cI tell you a good deal like.\u201d Jacques Three\u000apacifically remarked, \u201cHe is so much in your mind, see you, madame.\u201d\u000a The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, \u201cYes, my faith! And you\u000aare looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more\u000ato-morrow!\u201d\u000a\u000aCarton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow\u000aforefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning\u000atheir arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence\u000aof a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without\u000adisturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed\u000atheir conversation.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is true what madame says,\u201d observed Jacques Three. \u201cWhy stop? There\u000ais great force in that. Why stop?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, well,\u201d reasoned Defarge, \u201cbut one must stop somewhere. After all,\u000athe question is still where?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt extermination,\u201d said madame.\u000a\u000a\u201cMagnificent!\u201d croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly\u000aapproved.\u000a\u000a\u201cExtermination is good doctrine, my wife,\u201d said Defarge, rather\u000atroubled; \u201cin general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has\u000asuffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when\u000athe paper was read.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have observed his face!\u201d repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily.\u000a\u201cYes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the\u000aface of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd you have observed, my wife,\u201d said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner,\u000a\u201cthe anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have observed his daughter,\u201d repeated madame; \u201cyes, I have observed\u000ahis daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I\u000ahave observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and\u000aI have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my\u000afinger--!\u201d She seemed to raise it (the listener\u2019s eyes were always on\u000ahis paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as\u000aif the axe had dropped.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe citizeness is superb!\u201d croaked the Juryman.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is an Angel!\u201d said The Vengeance, and embraced her.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs to thee,\u201d pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, \u201cif it\u000adepended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this\u000aman even now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo!\u201d protested Defarge. \u201cNot if to lift this glass would do it! But I\u000awould leave the matter there. I say, stop there.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSee you then, Jacques,\u201d said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; \u201cand see you,\u000atoo, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as\u000atyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register,\u000adoomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is so,\u201d assented Defarge, without being asked.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds\u000athis paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the\u000anight when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot,\u000aby the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is so,\u201d assented Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is\u000aburnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between\u000athose iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is\u000athat so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is so,\u201d assented Defarge again.\u000a\u000a\u201cI communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two\u000ahands as I smite it now, and I tell him, \u2018Defarge, I was brought up\u000aamong the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured\u000aby the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my\u000afamily. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground\u000awas my sister, that husband was my sister\u2019s husband, that unborn child\u000awas their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father,\u000athose dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things\u000adescends to me!\u2019 Ask him, is that so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is so,\u201d assented Defarge once more.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen tell Wind and Fire where to stop,\u201d returned madame; \u201cbut don\u2019t\u000atell me.\u201d\u000a\u000aBoth her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature\u000aof her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing\u000aher--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed\u000aa few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but\u000aonly elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. \u201cTell\u000athe Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!\u201d\u000a\u000aCustomers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer\u000apaid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as\u000aa stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge\u000atook him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.\u000aThe English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might\u000abe a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and\u000adeep.\u000a\u000aBut, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the\u000aprison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present\u000ahimself in Mr. Lorry\u2019s room again, where he found the old gentleman\u000awalking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie\u000auntil just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and\u000akeep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the\u000abanking-house towards four o\u2019clock. She had some faint hopes that his\u000amediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been\u000amore than five hours gone: where could he be?\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and\u000ahe being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he\u000ashould go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.\u000aIn the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.\u000a\u000aHe waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette\u000adid not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and\u000abrought none. Where could he be?\u000a\u000aThey were discussing this question, and were almost building up some\u000aweak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on\u000athe stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was\u000alost.\u000a\u000aWhether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that\u000atime traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at\u000athem, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.\u000a\u000a\u201cI cannot find it,\u201d said he, \u201cand I must have it. Where is it?\u201d\u000a\u000aHis head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look\u000astraying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I\u000acan\u2019t find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must\u000afinish those shoes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.\u000a\u000a\u201cCome, come!\u201d said he, in a whimpering miserable way; \u201clet me get to\u000awork. Give me my work.\u201d\u000a\u000aReceiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the\u000aground, like a distracted child.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t torture a poor forlorn wretch,\u201d he implored them, with a dreadful\u000acry; \u201cbut give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are\u000anot done to-night?\u201d\u000a\u000aLost, utterly lost!\u000a\u000aIt was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him,\u000athat--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and\u000asoothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should\u000ahave his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the\u000aembers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret\u000atime were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into\u000athe exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.\u000a\u000aAffected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle\u000aof ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely\u000adaughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both\u000atoo strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with\u000aone meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:\u000a\u000a\u201cThe last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken\u000ato her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to\u000ame? Don\u2019t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and\u000aexact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not doubt it,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry. \u201cSay on.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously\u000arocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as\u000athey would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the\u000anight.\u000a\u000aCarton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his\u000afeet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to\u000acarry the lists of his day\u2019s duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton\u000atook it up, and there was a folded paper in it. \u201cWe should look\u000aat this!\u201d he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and\u000aexclaimed, \u201cThank _God!_\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.\u000a\u000a\u201cA moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,\u201d he put his hand in\u000ahis coat, and took another paper from it, \u201cthat is the certificate which\u000aenables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton,\u000aan Englishman?\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.\u000a\u000a\u201cKeep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you\u000aremember, and I had better not take it into the prison.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor\u000aManette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him\u000aand his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the\u000afrontier! You see?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPerhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil,\u000ayesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don\u2019t stay to look; put it\u000aup carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until\u000awithin this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is\u000agood, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to\u000athink, will be.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are not in danger?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by Madame\u000aDefarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of that\u000awoman\u2019s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong\u000acolours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He\u000aconfirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall,\u000ais under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by\u000aMadame Defarge as to his having seen Her\u201d--he never mentioned Lucie\u2019s\u000aname--\u201cmaking signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that\u000athe pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will\u000ainvolve her life--and perhaps her child\u2019s--and perhaps her father\u2019s--for\u000aboth have been seen with her at that place. Don\u2019t look so horrified. You\u000awill save them all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHeaven grant I may, Carton! But how?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend\u000aon no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place\u000auntil after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards;\u000amore probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to\u000amourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her\u000afather would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the\u000ainveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that\u000astrength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. You follow me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSo attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for\u000athe moment I lose sight,\u201d touching the back of the Doctor\u2019s chair, \u201ceven\u000aof this distress.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast\u000aas quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have been\u000acompleted for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow have your\u000ahorses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o\u2019clock in the\u000aafternoon.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt shall be done!\u201d\u000a\u000aHis manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the\u000aflame, and was as quick as youth.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better man?\u000aTell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child\u000aand her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head\u000abeside her husband\u2019s cheerfully.\u201d He faltered for an instant; then went\u000aon as before. \u201cFor the sake of her child and her father, press upon her\u000athe necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour. Tell\u000aher that it was her husband\u2019s last arrangement. Tell her that more\u000adepends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her\u000afather, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am sure of it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in\u000athe courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage.\u000aThe moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will\u000areserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and\u000athen for England!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy, then,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady\u000ahand, \u201cit does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young\u000aand ardent man at my side.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBy the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing will\u000ainfluence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one\u000aanother.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing, Carton.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cRemember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it--for\u000aany reason--and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must\u000ainevitably be sacrificed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!\u201d\u000a\u000aThough he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even\u000aput the old man\u2019s hand to his lips, he did not part from him then. He\u000ahelped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers,\u000aas to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find\u000awhere the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought\u000ato have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the\u000acourtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in\u000athe memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to\u000ait--outwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained\u000athere for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of\u000aher room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a\u000aFarewell.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXIII. Fifty-two\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited\u000atheir fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two were\u000ato roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless\u000aeverlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants\u000awere appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday,\u000athe blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set\u000aapart.\u000a\u000aTwo score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy,\u000awhose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose\u000apoverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered\u000ain the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees;\u000aand the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,\u000aintolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally\u000awithout distinction.\u000a\u000aCharles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no\u000aflattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line\u000aof the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had\u000afully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,\u000athat he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could\u000aavail him nothing.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh\u000abefore him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life\u000awas strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts\u000aand degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and\u000awhen he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded,\u000athis was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts,\u000aa turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against\u000aresignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and\u000achild who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a\u000aselfish thing.\u000a\u000aBut, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there\u000awas no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same\u000aroad wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate\u000ahim. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind\u000aenjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So,\u000aby degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his\u000athoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.\u000a\u000aBefore it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had\u000atravelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means\u000aof writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the\u000aprison lamps should be extinguished.\u000a\u000aHe wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing\u000aof her father\u2019s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself,\u000aand that he had been as ignorant as she of his father\u2019s and uncle\u2019s\u000aresponsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had\u000aalready explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name\u000ahe had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that\u000aher father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he\u000ahad still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her,\u000afor her father\u2019s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had\u000abecome oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled\u000ato him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on\u000athat old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had\u000apreserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that\u000ahe had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no\u000amention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had\u000adiscovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He\u000abesought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console\u000aher father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think\u000aof, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly\u000areproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint\u000asakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and\u000ablessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their\u000adear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her\u000afather.\u000a\u000aTo her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her\u000afather that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And\u000ahe told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any\u000adespondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be\u000atending.\u000a\u000aTo Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs.\u000aThat done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm\u000aattachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so\u000afull of the others, that he never once thought of him.\u000a\u000aHe had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When\u000ahe lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.\u000a\u000aBut, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining\u000aforms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had\u000anothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of\u000aheart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and\u000ahe had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even\u000asuffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there\u000awas no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the\u000asombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it\u000aflashed upon his mind, \u201cthis is the day of my death!\u201d\u000a\u000aThus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads\u000awere to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could\u000ameet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking\u000athoughts, which was very difficult to master.\u000a\u000aHe had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How\u000ahigh it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be\u000astood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed\u000ared, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first,\u000aor might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise\u000adirected by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless\u000atimes. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no\u000afear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what\u000ato do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the\u000afew swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like\u000athe wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.\u000a\u000aThe hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the\u000anumbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for\u000aever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard\u000acontest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed\u000ahim, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly\u000arepeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over.\u000aHe could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for\u000ahimself and for them.\u000a\u000aTwelve gone for ever.\u000a\u000aHe had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would\u000abe summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily\u000aand slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two\u000abefore his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the\u000ainterval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.\u000a\u000aWalking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very\u000adifferent man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force,\u000ahe heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour had\u000ameasured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his\u000arecovered self-possession, he thought, \u201cThere is but another now,\u201d and\u000aturned to walk again.\u000a\u000aFootsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.\u000a\u000aThe key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or\u000aas it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: \u201cHe has never seen\u000ame here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near. Lose\u000ano time!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him\u000aface to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his\u000afeatures, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.\u000a\u000aThere was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the\u000afirst moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own\u000aimagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner\u2019s\u000ahand, and it was his real grasp.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cI could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now. You\u000aare not\u201d--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--\u201ca prisoner?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers\u000ahere, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her--your\u000awife, dear Darnay.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe prisoner wrung his hand.\u000a\u000a\u201cI bring you a request from her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you\u000ain the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well\u000aremember.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe prisoner turned his face partly aside.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have\u000ano time to tell you. You must comply with it--take off those boots you\u000awear, and draw on these of mine.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.\u000aCarton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got\u000ahim down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.\u000a\u000a\u201cDraw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your will to\u000athem. Quick!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCarton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done. You\u000awill only die with me. It is madness.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I ask you\u000ato pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here. Change\u000athat cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While you do\u000ait, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like\u000athis of mine!\u201d\u000a\u000aWith wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action,\u000athat appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him.\u000aThe prisoner was like a young child in his hands.\u000a\u000a\u201cCarton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never\u000acan be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you\u000anot to add your death to the bitterness of mine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that,\u000arefuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand\u000asteady enough to write?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was when you came in.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!\u201d\u000a\u000aPressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table.\u000aCarton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.\u000a\u000a\u201cWrite exactly as I speak.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo whom do I address it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo no one.\u201d Carton still had his hand in his breast.\u000a\u000a\u201cDo I date it?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with\u000ahis hand in his breast, looked down.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018If you remember,\u2019\u201d said Carton, dictating, \u201c\u2018the words that passed\u000abetween us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.\u000aYou do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look\u000aup in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon\u000asomething.\u000a\u000a\u201cHave you written \u2018forget them\u2019?\u201d Carton asked.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo; I am not armed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is it in your hand?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more.\u201d He\u000adictated again. \u201c\u2018I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove\u000athem. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.\u2019\u201d As he said these\u000awords with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly\u000amoved down close to the writer\u2019s face.\u000a\u000aThe pen dropped from Darnay\u2019s fingers on the table, and he looked about\u000ahim vacantly.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat vapour is that?\u201d he asked.\u000a\u000a\u201cVapour?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSomething that crossed me?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen\u000aand finish. Hurry, hurry!\u201d\u000a\u000aAs if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the\u000aprisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton\u000awith clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his\u000ahand again in his breast--looked steadily at him.\u000a\u000a\u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe prisoner bent over the paper, once more.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018If it had been otherwise;\u2019\u201d Carton\u2019s hand was again watchfully and\u000asoftly stealing down; \u201c\u2018I never should have used the longer opportunity.\u000aIf it had been otherwise;\u2019\u201d the hand was at the prisoner\u2019s face; \u201c\u2018I\u000ashould but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been\u000aotherwise--\u2019\u201d Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into\u000aunintelligible signs.\u000a\u000aCarton\u2019s hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up\u000awith a reproachful look, but Carton\u2019s hand was close and firm at his\u000anostrils, and Carton\u2019s left arm caught him round the waist. For a few\u000aseconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his\u000alife for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on\u000athe ground.\u000a\u000aQuickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton\u000adressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back\u000ahis hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he\u000asoftly called, \u201cEnter there! Come in!\u201d and the Spy presented himself.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou see?\u201d said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the\u000ainsensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: \u201cis your hazard very\u000agreat?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Carton,\u201d the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, \u201cmy\u000ahazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to\u000athe whole of your bargain.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t fear me. I will be true to the death.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being\u000amade right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHave no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the\u000arest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and\u000atake me to the coach.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou?\u201d said the Spy nervously.\u000a\u000a\u201cHim, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which\u000ayou brought me in?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you\u000atake me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has\u000ahappened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands.\u000aQuick! Call assistance!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou swear not to betray me?\u201d said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a\u000alast moment.\u000a\u000a\u201cMan, man!\u201d returned Carton, stamping his foot; \u201chave I sworn by no\u000asolemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious\u000amoments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place\u000ahim yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him\u000ayourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of\u000alast night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his\u000aforehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow, then?\u201d said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. \u201cSo\u000aafflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of\u000aSainte Guillotine?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA good patriot,\u201d said the other, \u201ccould hardly have been more afflicted\u000aif the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had\u000abrought to the door, and bent to carry it away.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe time is short, Evremonde,\u201d said the Spy, in a warning voice.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know it well,\u201d answered Carton. \u201cBe careful of my friend, I entreat\u000ayou, and leave me.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cCome, then, my children,\u201d said Barsad. \u201cLift him, and come away!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of\u000alistening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote\u000asuspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed,\u000afootsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry\u000amade, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he\u000asat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.\u000a\u000aSounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then\u000abegan to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and\u000afinally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely\u000asaying, \u201cFollow me, Evremonde!\u201d and he followed into a large dark room,\u000aat a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows\u000awithin, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern\u000athe others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were\u000astanding; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;\u000abut, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking\u000afixedly at the ground.\u000a\u000aAs he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two\u000awere brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him,\u000aas having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of\u000adiscovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young\u000awoman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was\u000ano vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from\u000athe seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.\u000a\u000a\u201cCitizen Evremonde,\u201d she said, touching him with her cold hand. \u201cI am a\u000apoor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe murmured for answer: \u201cTrue. I forget what you were accused of?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPlots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it\u000alikely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature\u000alike me?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears\u000astarted from his eyes.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing. I\u000aam not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good\u000ato us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be,\u000aCitizen Evremonde. Such a poor weak little creature!\u201d\u000a\u000aAs the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it\u000awarmed and softened to this pitiable girl.\u000a\u000a\u201cI heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was true?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was. But, I was again taken and condemned.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your\u000ahand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me\u000amore courage.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in\u000athem, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young\u000afingers, and touched his lips.\u000a\u000a\u201cAre you dying for him?\u201d she whispered.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd his wife and child. Hush! Yes.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cO you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.\u201d\u000a\u000a        *****\u000a\u000aThe same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that\u000asame hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about\u000ait, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.\u000a\u000a\u201cWho goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe papers are handed out, and read.\u000a\u000a\u201cAlexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man\u000apointed out.\u000a\u000a\u201cApparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The\u000aRevolution-fever will have been too much for him?\u201d\u000a\u000aGreatly too much for him.\u000a\u000a\u201cHah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is she?\u201d\u000a\u000aThis is she.\u000a\u000a\u201cApparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is.\u000a\u000a\u201cHah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child. English.\u000aThis is she?\u201d\u000a\u000aShe and no other.\u000a\u000a\u201cKiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican;\u000asomething new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton. Advocate.\u000aEnglish. Which is he?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.\u000a\u000a\u201cApparently the English advocate is in a swoon?\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that\u000ahe is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is\u000aunder the displeasure of the Republic.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the\u000adispleasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window.\u000aJarvis Lorry. Banker. English. Which is he?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am he. Necessarily, being the last.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It\u000ais Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach\u000adoor, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round the\u000acarriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it\u000acarries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to\u000athe coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its\u000amother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of\u000aan aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.\u000a\u000a\u201cBehold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne can depart, citizen?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOne can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI salute you, citizens.--And the first danger passed!\u201d\u000a\u000aThese are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and\u000alooks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there\u000ais the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.\u000a\u000a\u201cAre we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go faster?\u201d\u000a asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too much;\u000ait would rouse suspicion.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLook back, look back, and see if we are pursued!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued.\u201d\u000a\u000aHouses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings,\u000adye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless\u000atrees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on\u000aeither side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the\u000astones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and\u000asloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our\u000awild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing\u000aanything but stopping.\u000a\u000aOut of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary\u000afarms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes,\u000aavenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back\u000aby another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven,\u000ano. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush!\u000athe posting-house.\u000a\u000aLeisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in\u000athe little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it\u000aof ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible\u000aexistence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and\u000aplaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count\u000atheir money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results.\u000aAll the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would\u000afar outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.\u000a\u000aAt length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left\u000abehind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and\u000aon the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with\u000aanimated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their\u000ahaunches. We are pursued?\u000a\u000a\u201cHo! Within the carriage there. Speak then!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow many did they say?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI do not understand you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c--At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFifty-two.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it\u000aforty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes\u000ahandsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and\u000ato speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him,\u000aby his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help\u000aus! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.\u000a\u000aThe wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and\u000athe moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of\u000aus; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXIV. The Knitting Done\u000a\u000a\u000aIn that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate\u000aMadame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and\u000aJacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame\u000aDefarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer,\u000aerst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the\u000aconference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who\u000awas not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut our Defarge,\u201d said Jacques Three, \u201cis undoubtedly a good\u000aRepublican? Eh?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no better,\u201d the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill\u000anotes, \u201cin France.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPeace, little Vengeance,\u201d said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with\u000aa slight frown on her lieutenant\u2019s lips, \u201chear me speak. My husband,\u000afellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved\u000awell of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has\u000ahis weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a great pity,\u201d croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head,\u000awith his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; \u201cit is not quite like a good\u000acitizen; it is a thing to regret.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSee you,\u201d said madame, \u201cI care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear\u000ahis head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to\u000ame. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and\u000achild must follow the husband and father.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe has a fine head for it,\u201d croaked Jacques Three. \u201cI have seen blue\u000aeyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held\u000athem up.\u201d Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe child also,\u201d observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment\u000aof his words, \u201chas golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child\u000athere. It is a pretty sight!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn a word,\u201d said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction,\u000a\u201cI cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since\u000alast night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects;\u000abut also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning,\u000aand then they might escape.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat must never be,\u201d croaked Jacques Three; \u201cno one must escape. We\u000ahave not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn a word,\u201d Madame Defarge went on, \u201cmy husband has not my reason for\u000apursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for\u000aregarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,\u000atherefore. Come hither, little citizen.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the\u000asubmission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.\u000a\u000a\u201cTouching those signals, little citizen,\u201d said Madame Defarge, sternly,\u000a\u201cthat she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them\u000athis very day?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAy, ay, why not!\u201d cried the sawyer. \u201cEvery day, in all weathers, from\u000atwo to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes\u000awithout. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental\u000aimitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had\u000anever seen.\u000a\u000a\u201cClearly plots,\u201d said Jacques Three. \u201cTransparently!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no doubt of the Jury?\u201d inquired Madame Defarge, letting her\u000aeyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.\u000a\u000a\u201cRely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my\u000afellow-Jurymen.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, let me see,\u201d said Madame Defarge, pondering again. \u201cYet once more!\u000aCan I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can\u000aI spare him?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe would count as one head,\u201d observed Jacques Three, in a low voice.\u000a\u201cWe really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe was signalling with her when I saw her,\u201d argued Madame Defarge; \u201cI\u000acannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and\u000atrust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a\u000abad witness.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent\u000aprotestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of\u000awitnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a\u000acelestial witness.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe must take his chance,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cNo, I cannot spare\u000ahim! You are engaged at three o\u2019clock; you are going to see the batch of\u000ato-day executed.--You?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in\u000athe affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent\u000aof Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of\u000aRepublicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of\u000asmoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national\u000abarber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been\u000asuspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at\u000ahim out of Madame Defarge\u2019s head) of having his small individual fears\u000afor his own personal safety, every hour in the day.\u000a\u000a\u201cI,\u201d said madame, \u201cam equally engaged at the same place. After it is\u000aover--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we\u000awill give information against these people at my Section.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the\u000acitizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded\u000aher glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and\u000ahid his confusion over the handle of his saw.\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to\u000athe door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:\u000a\u000a\u201cShe will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will\u000abe mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach the\u000ajustice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.\u000aI will go to her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!\u201d exclaimed Jacques\u000aThree, rapturously. \u201cAh, my cherished!\u201d cried The Vengeance; and\u000aembraced her.\u000a\u000a\u201cTake you my knitting,\u201d said Madame Defarge, placing it in her\u000alieutenant\u2019s hands, \u201cand have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep\u000ame my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a\u000agreater concourse than usual, to-day.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI willingly obey the orders of my Chief,\u201d said The Vengeance with\u000aalacrity, and kissing her cheek. \u201cYou will not be late?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI shall be there before the commencement.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,\u201d said\u000aThe Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the\u000astreet, \u201cbefore the tumbrils arrive!\u201d\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and\u000amight be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the\u000amud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the\u000aJuryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative\u000aof her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.\u000a\u000aThere were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully\u000adisfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded\u000athan this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a\u000astrong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great\u000adetermination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart\u000ato its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an\u000ainstinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have\u000aheaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood\u000awith a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,\u000aopportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without\u000apity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of\u000aher.\u000a\u000aIt was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of\u000ahis forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that\u000ahis wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was\u000ainsufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and\u000aher prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made\u000ahopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had\u000abeen laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which\u000ashe had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had\u000abeen ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any\u000asofter feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who\u000asent her there.\u000a\u000aSuch a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly\u000aworn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her\u000adark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her\u000abosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened\u000adagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such\u000aa character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually\u000awalked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown\u000asea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.\u000a\u000aNow, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment\u000awaiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,\u000athe difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry\u2019s\u000aattention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,\u000abut it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining\u000ait and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their\u000aescape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.\u000aFinally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross\u000aand Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at\u000athree o\u2019clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.\u000aUnencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,\u000apassing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in\u000aadvance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours\u000aof the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.\u000a\u000aSeeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that\u000apressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had\u000abeheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had\u000apassed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding\u000atheir arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,\u000ataking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the\u000aelse-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,\u201d said Miss Pross, whose agitation\u000awas so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:\u000a\u201cwhat do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another\u000acarriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken\u000asuspicion.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMy opinion, miss,\u201d returned Mr. Cruncher, \u201cis as you\u2019re right. Likewise\u000awot I\u2019ll stand by you, right or wrong.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,\u201d said\u000aMiss Pross, wildly crying, \u201cthat I am incapable of forming any plan. Are\u000a_you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cRespectin\u2019 a future spear o\u2019 life, miss,\u201d returned Mr. Cruncher, \u201cI\u000ahope so. Respectin\u2019 any present use o\u2019 this here blessed old head o\u2019\u000amine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o\u2019\u000atwo promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here\u000acrisis?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, for gracious sake!\u201d cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, \u201crecord\u000athem at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFirst,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with\u000aan ashy and solemn visage, \u201cthem poor things well out o\u2019 this, never no\u000amore will I do it, never no more!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cthat you\u000anever will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it\u000anecessary to mention more particularly what it is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, miss,\u201d returned Jerry, \u201cit shall not be named to you. Second: them\u000apoor things well out o\u2019 this, and never no more will I interfere with\u000aMrs. Cruncher\u2019s flopping, never no more!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,\u201d said Miss Pross,\u000astriving to dry her eyes and compose herself, \u201cI have no doubt it\u000ais best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own\u000asuperintendence.--O my poor darlings!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI go so far as to say, miss, moreover,\u201d proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a\u000amost alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--\u201cand let my words\u000abe took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my\u000aopinions respectin\u2019 flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only\u000ahope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present\u000atime.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,\u201d cried the distracted\u000aMiss Pross, \u201cand I hope she finds it answering her expectations.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cForbid it,\u201d proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,\u000aadditional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold\u000aout, \u201cas anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my\u000aearnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn\u2019t all\u000aflop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get \u2018em out o\u2019 this here dismal\u000arisk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!\u201d This was Mr. Cruncher\u2019s\u000aconclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.\u000a\u000aAnd still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came\u000anearer and nearer.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we ever get back to our native land,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cyou may rely\u000aupon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and\u000aunderstand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events\u000ayou may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in\u000aearnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr.\u000aCruncher, let us think!\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer\u000aand nearer.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you were to go before,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cand stop the vehicle and\u000ahorses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn\u2019t\u000athat be best?\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher thought it might be best.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere could you wait for me?\u201d asked Miss Pross.\u000a\u000aMr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but\u000aTemple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame\u000aDefarge was drawing very near indeed.\u000a\u000a\u201cBy the cathedral door,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cWould it be much out of\u000athe way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two\u000atowers?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, miss,\u201d answered Mr. Cruncher.\u000a\u000a\u201cThen, like the best of men,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cgo to the posting-house\u000astraight, and make that change.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am doubtful,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,\u000a\u201cabout leaving of you, you see. We don\u2019t know what may happen.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHeaven knows we don\u2019t,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cbut have no fear for me.\u000aTake me in at the cathedral, at Three o\u2019Clock, or as near it as you can,\u000aand I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain\u000aof it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives\u000athat may depend on both of us!\u201d\u000a\u000aThis exordium, and Miss Pross\u2019s two hands in quite agonised entreaty\u000aclasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he\u000aimmediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself\u000ato follow as she had proposed.\u000a\u000aThe having originated a precaution which was already in course of\u000aexecution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing\u000aher appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the\u000astreets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty\u000aminutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.\u000a\u000aAfraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted\u000arooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door\u000ain them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,\u000awhich were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she\u000acould not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the\u000adripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there\u000awas no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried\u000aout, for she saw a figure standing in the room.\u000a\u000aThe basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of\u000aMadame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,\u000athose feet had come to meet that water.\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, \u201cThe wife of Evremonde;\u000awhere is she?\u201d\u000a\u000aIt flashed upon Miss Pross\u2019s mind that the doors were all standing open,\u000aand would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were\u000afour in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before\u000athe door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge\u2019s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,\u000aand rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful\u000aabout her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,\u000aof her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different\u000away, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,\u201d said Miss\u000aPross, in her breathing. \u201cNevertheless, you shall not get the better of\u000ame. I am an Englishwoman.\u201d\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of\u000aMiss Pross\u2019s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight,\u000ahard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a\u000awoman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that\u000aMiss Pross was the family\u2019s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well\u000athat Madame Defarge was the family\u2019s malevolent enemy.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn my way yonder,\u201d said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of\u000aher hand towards the fatal spot, \u201cwhere they reserve my chair and my\u000aknitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I\u000awish to see her.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know that your intentions are evil,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cand you may\u000adepend upon it, I\u2019ll hold my own against them.\u201d\u000a\u000aEach spoke in her own language; neither understood the other\u2019s words;\u000aboth were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what\u000athe unintelligible words meant.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this\u000amoment,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cGood patriots will know what that means.\u000aLet me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf those eyes of yours were bed-winches,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cand I\u000awas an English four-poster, they shouldn\u2019t loose a splinter of me. No,\u000ayou wicked foreign woman; I am your match.\u201d\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in\u000adetail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set\u000aat naught.\u000a\u000a\u201cWoman imbecile and pig-like!\u201d said Madame Defarge, frowning. \u201cI take no\u000aanswer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand\u000ato see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!\u201d\u000a This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.\u000a\u000a\u201cI little thought,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cthat I should ever want to\u000aunderstand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,\u000aexcept the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any\u000apart of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aNeither of them for a single moment released the other\u2019s eyes. Madame\u000aDefarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross\u000afirst became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am a Briton,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cI am desperate. I don\u2019t care an\u000aEnglish Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the\u000agreater hope there is for my Ladybird. I\u2019ll not leave a handful of that\u000adark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!\u201d\u000a\u000aThus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes\u000abetween every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.\u000aThus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.\u000a\u000aBut, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the\u000airrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame\u000aDefarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. \u201cHa, ha!\u201d she\u000alaughed, \u201cyou poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that\u000aDoctor.\u201d Then she raised her voice and called out, \u201cCitizen Doctor! Wife\u000aof Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool,\u000aanswer the Citizeness Defarge!\u201d\u000a\u000aPerhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the\u000aexpression of Miss Pross\u2019s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from\u000aeither suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.\u000aThree of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.\u000a\u000a\u201cThose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there\u000aare odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind\u000ayou! Let me look.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNever!\u201d said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as\u000aMadame Defarge understood the answer.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and\u000abrought back,\u201d said Madame Defarge to herself.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t know whether they are in that room or not, you are\u000auncertain what to do,\u201d said Miss Pross to herself; \u201cand you shall not\u000aknow that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know\u000athat, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,\u000aI will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,\u201d said\u000aMadame Defarge.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are\u000anot likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here,\u000awhile every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to\u000amy darling,\u201d said Miss Pross.\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the\u000amoment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.\u000aIt was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,\u000awith the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,\u000aclasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle\u000athat they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her\u000aface; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and\u000aclung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.\u000a\u000aSoon, Madame Defarge\u2019s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled\u000awaist. \u201cIt is under my arm,\u201d said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, \u201cyou\u000ashall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold\u000ayou till one or other of us faints or dies!\u201d\u000a\u000aMadame Defarge\u2019s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw\u000awhat it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood\u000aalone--blinded with smoke.\u000a\u000aAll this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful\u000astillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman\u000awhose body lay lifeless on the ground.\u000a\u000aIn the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the\u000abody as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for\u000afruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of\u000awhat she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to\u000ago in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to\u000aget the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on,\u000aout on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking\u000aaway the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe\u000aand to cry, and then got up and hurried away.\u000a\u000aBy good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have\u000agone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she\u000awas naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement\u000alike any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of\u000agripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her\u000adress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a\u000ahundred ways.\u000a\u000aIn crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving\u000aat the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there,\u000ashe thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if\u000ait were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains\u000adiscovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and\u000acharged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the\u000aescort appeared, took her in, and took her away.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs there any noise in the streets?\u201d she asked him.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe usual noises,\u201d Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the\u000aquestion and by her aspect.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t hear you,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could\u000anot hear him. \u201cSo I\u2019ll nod my head,\u201d thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, \u201cat\u000aall events she\u2019ll see that.\u201d And she did.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs there any noise in the streets now?\u201d asked Miss Pross again,\u000apresently.\u000a\u000aAgain Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t hear it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cGone deaf in an hour?\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind\u000amuch disturbed; \u201cwot\u2019s come to her?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI feel,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cas if there had been a flash and a crash,\u000aand that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBlest if she ain\u2019t in a queer condition!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, more and\u000amore disturbed. \u201cWot can she have been a takin\u2019, to keep her courage up?\u000aHark! There\u2019s the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI can hear,\u201d said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, \u201cnothing. O,\u000amy good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness,\u000aand that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be\u000abroken any more as long as my life lasts.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIf she don\u2019t hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their\u000ajourney\u2019s end,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, \u201cit\u2019s my\u000aopinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd indeed she never did.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXV. The Footsteps Die Out For Ever\u000a\u000a\u000aAlong the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six\u000atumbrils carry the day\u2019s wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and\u000ainsatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself,\u000aare fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in\u000aFrance, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf,\u000aa root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under\u000aconditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush\u000ahumanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will\u000atwist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of\u000arapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield\u000athe same fruit according to its kind.\u000a\u000aSix tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what\u000athey were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be\u000athe carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the\u000atoilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father\u2019s\u000ahouse but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!\u000aNo; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order\u000aof the Creator, never reverses his transformations. \u201cIf thou be changed\u000ainto this shape by the will of God,\u201d say the seers to the enchanted, in\u000athe wise Arabian stories, \u201cthen remain so! But, if thou wear this\u000aform through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!\u201d\u000a Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.\u000a\u000aAs the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up\u000aa long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces\u000aare thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.\u000aSo used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that\u000ain many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the\u000ahands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in\u000athe tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;\u000athen he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a\u000acurator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to\u000atell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.\u000a\u000aOf the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all\u000athings on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with\u000aa lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with\u000adrooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so\u000aheedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as\u000athey have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,\u000aand think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and\u000ahe a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made\u000adrunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole\u000anumber appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.\u000a\u000aThere is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,\u000aand faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some\u000aquestion. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is\u000aalways followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The\u000ahorsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with\u000atheir swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands\u000aat the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a\u000amere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has\u000ano curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the\u000agirl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised\u000aagainst him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he\u000ashakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily\u000atouch his face, his arms being bound.\u000a\u000aOn the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands\u000athe Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there.\u000aHe looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, \u201cHas he\u000asacrificed me?\u201d when his face clears, as he looks into the third.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhich is Evremonde?\u201d says a man behind him.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat. At the back there.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWith his hand in the girl\u2019s?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe man cries, \u201cDown, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats!\u000aDown, Evremonde!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHush, hush!\u201d the Spy entreats him, timidly.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd why not, citizen?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.\u000aLet him be at peace.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut the man continuing to exclaim, \u201cDown, Evremonde!\u201d the face of\u000aEvremonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then sees the\u000aSpy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.\u000a\u000aThe clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the\u000apopulace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and\u000aend. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and\u000aclose behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following\u000ato the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of\u000apublic diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On one of the\u000afore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend.\u000a\u000a\u201cTherese!\u201d she cries, in her shrill tones. \u201cWho has seen her? Therese\u000aDefarge!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe never missed before,\u201d says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo; nor will she miss now,\u201d cries The Vengeance, petulantly. \u201cTherese.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLouder,\u201d the woman recommends.\u000a\u000aAy! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear\u000athee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet\u000ait will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her,\u000alingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread\u000adeeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far\u000aenough to find her!\u000a\u000a\u201cBad Fortune!\u201d cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, \u201cand\u000ahere are the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and\u000ashe not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for\u000aher. I cry with vexation and disappointment!\u201d\u000a\u000aAs The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils\u000abegin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are\u000arobed and ready. Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who\u000ascarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could\u000athink and speak, count One.\u000a\u000aThe second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash!--And\u000athe knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.\u000a\u000aThe supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next\u000aafter him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but\u000astill holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the\u000acrashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into\u000ahis face and thanks him.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am\u000anaturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been\u000aable to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might\u000ahave hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by\u000aHeaven.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOr you to me,\u201d says Sydney Carton. \u201cKeep your eyes upon me, dear child,\u000aand mind no other object.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let\u000ait go, if they are rapid.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey will be rapid. Fear not!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as\u000aif they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to\u000aheart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart\u000aand differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home\u000atogether, and to rest in her bosom.\u000a\u000a\u201cBrave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I\u000aam very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTell me what it is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I\u000alove very dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a\u000afarmer\u2019s house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows\u000anothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I\u000atell her! It is better as it is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, yes: better as it is.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still\u000athinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so\u000amuch support, is this:--If the Republic really does good to the poor,\u000aand they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may\u000alive a long time: she may even live to be old.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat then, my gentle sister?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you think:\u201d the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much\u000aendurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble:\u000a\u201cthat it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land\u000awhere I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now? Is the\u000amoment come?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.\u000aThe spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than\u000aa sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before\u000ahim--is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth\u000ain me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and\u000abelieveth in me shall never die.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing\u000aon of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells\u000aforward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.\u000aTwenty-Three.\u000a\u000a        *****\u000a\u000aThey said of him, about the city that night, that it was the\u000apeacefullest man\u2019s face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked\u000asublime and prophetic.\u000a\u000aOne of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked\u000aat the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to\u000awrite down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any\u000autterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:\u000a\u000a\u201cI see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge,\u000along ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of\u000athe old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease\u000aout of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people\u000arising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in\u000atheir triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil\u000aof this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural\u000abirth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.\u000a\u000a\u201cI see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful,\u000aprosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see\u000aHer with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father,\u000aaged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his\u000ahealing office, and at peace. I see the good old man, so long their\u000afriend, in ten years\u2019 time enriching them with all he has, and passing\u000atranquilly to his reward.\u000a\u000a\u201cI see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of\u000atheir descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping\u000afor me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their\u000acourse done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know\u000athat each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other\u2019s soul,\u000athan I was in the souls of both.\u000a\u000a\u201cI see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man\u000awinning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him\u000awinning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the\u000alight of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him,\u000afore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name,\u000awith a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place--then fair to\u000alook upon, with not a trace of this day\u2019s disfigurement--and I hear him\u000atell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a\u000afar, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens\u000a\u000a*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A TALE OF TWO CITIES ***\u000a\u000a***** This file should be named 98-0.txt or 98-0.zip *****\u000aThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\u000a        http://www.gutenberg.org/9/98/\u000a\u000aProduced by Judith Boss\u000a\u000aUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\u000awill be renamed.\u000a\u000aCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\u000aone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\u000a(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\u000apermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\u000aLiterary Archive Foundation\u000a\u000aProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\u000aspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\u000aincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\u000afreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\u000aarray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\u000a($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\u000astatus with the IRS.\u000a\u000aThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\u000acharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\u000aStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\u000aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\u000awith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\u000awhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\u000aSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\u000aparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\u000a\u000aWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\u000ahave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\u000aagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\u000aapproach us with offers to donate.\u000a\u000aInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\u000aany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\u000aoutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\u000a\u000aPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\u000amethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\u000aways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\u000aTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\u000a\u000a\u000aSection 5.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\u000aconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\u000awith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\u000aGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\u000a\u000a\u000aProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\u000aeditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\u000aunless a copyright notice is included.
