THE OPENING
   (al-Fatihah)
1. THE OPENING
(al-Fatihah
)
1.
In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Mer-
ciful.
2.
Praise be to Allah,
Lord of the Worlds.
3.
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
4.
Master of the Day of Judgment.
5.
It is You we worship, and upon You we call
for help.
6.
Guide us to the straight path.
7.
The path of those You have blessed, not of
those  against  whom  there  is  anger,  nor  of
those who are misguided.
2. THE HEIFER
(al-Baqarah
)
In the name of Allah,
the Gracious, the Merciful
1.
Alif, Lam, Meem.
2.
This is the Book in which there is no doubt,
a guide for the righteous.
3.
Those who believe in the unseen, and pe
r-
form  the  prayers,  and  give  from  what  We
have provided for them.
4.
And those who believe in what was revealed
to you, and in what was revealed before you,
and are certain of the Hereafter.
5.
These  are  upon  guidance  from  their  Lord.
These are the successf
ul.
6.
As for those who disbelieve
—
it is the same
for them, whether you have warned them, or
have not warned them
—
they do not believe.
7.
Allah  has  set  a  seal  on  their  hearts  and  on
their  hearing,  and  over  their  vision  is  a  veil.
They will have a severe to
rment.
8.
Among the people are those who say, “We
believe in Allah and in the Last Day,” but they
are not believers.
9.
They  seek  to  deceive  Allah  and  those  who
believe,  but  they  deceive  none  but  them-
selves, though they are not aware.
10.
In their hearts i
s sickness, and Allah has in-
creased their sickness. They will have a pain-
ful punishment because of their denial.
11.
And when it is said to them, “Do not make
trouble on earth,” they say, “We are only re-
formers.”
12.
In fact, they are the troublemakers, bu
t they
are not aware.
13.
And when it is said to them, “Believe as the
people have believed,” they say, “Shall we be-
lieve as the fools have believed?” In fact, it is
they who are the fools, but they do not know.
14.
And when they come across those who be-
lieve,  they  say,  “We  believe”;  but  when  they
are alone with their devils, they say, “We are
with you; we were only ridiculing.”
15.
It  is  Allah  who  ridicules  them,  and  leaves
them bewildered in their transgression.
16.
Those are they who have bartered error for
guidance;  but  their  trade  does  not  profit
them, and they are not guided.
17.
Their likeness is that of a person who kin-
dled  a  fire;  when  it  illuminated  all  around
him,  Allah  took  away  their  light,  and  left
them in darkness, unable to see.
18.
Deaf,
dumb, blind. They will not return.
19.
Or like a cloudburst from the sky, in which
is darkness, and thunder, and lightning. They
press  their  fingers  into  their  ears  from  the
thunderbolts, in fear of death. But Allah sur-
rounds the disbelievers.
20.
The
lightning  almost  snatches  their  sight
away. Whenever it illuminates for them, they
walk in it; but when it grows dark over them,
they  stand  still.  Had  Allah  willed,  He  could
have taken away their hearing and their sight.
Allah is capable of everything.
21.
O people! Worship your Lord who created
you and those before you, that you may attain
piety.

THE HEIFER
  (al
-Baqarah)
22.
He  who  made  the  earth  a  habitat  for  you,
and  the  sky  a  structure,  and  sends  water
down  from  the  sky,  and  brings  out  fruits
thereby,  as  a  sustenance  for  you.  T
herefore,
do not assign rivals to Allah while you know.
23.
And  if  you  are  in  doubt  about  what  We
have revealed to Our servant, then produce a
chapter  like  these,  and  call  your  witnesses
apart from Allah, if you are truthful.
24.
But if you do not—
and you
will not
—
then
beware  the  Fire  whose  fuel  is  people  and
stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
25.
And  give  good  news  to  those  who  believe
and  do  righteous  deeds;  that  they  will  have
gardens  beneath  which  rivers  flow.  When-
ever they are provided with fruit t
herefrom as
sustenance,  they  will  say,  “This  is  what  we
were provided with before,” and they will be
given  the  like  of  it.  And  they  will  have  pure
spouses  therein,  and  they  will  abide  therein
forever.
26.
Allah  does  not  shy  away  from  making  an
example of a
 gnat, or something above it. As
for those who believe, they know that it is the
Truth from their Lord. But as for those who
disbelieve,  they  say,  “What  did  Allah  intend
by   this   example?”   He   leads   astray   many
thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He
mis
leads thereby only the evildoers.
27.
Those who violate Allah’s covenant after its
confirmation, and sever what Allah has com-
manded  to  be  joined,  and  commit  evil  on
earth. These are the losers.
28.
How  can  you  deny  Allah,  when  you  were
dead  and  He  gave  yo
u  life,  then  He  will  put
you  to  death,  then  He  will  bring  you  to  life,
then to Him you will be returned?
29.
It is He who created for you everything on
earth,  then  turned  to  the  heaven,  and  made
them  seven  heavens.  And  He  is  aware  of  all
things.
30.
When
your Lord said to the angels, “I am
placing  a  successor  on  earth.”  They  said,
“Will You place in it someone who will cause
corruption in it and shed blood, while we de-
clare  Your  praises  and  sanctify  You?”  He
said, “I know what you do not know.”
31.
And  He  taught  Adam  the  names,  all  of
them;  then  he  presented  them  to  the  angels,
and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if you
are sincere.”
32.
They  said,  “Glory  be  to  You!  We  have  no
knowledge  except  what  You  have  taught  us.
It  is  you  who  are  the  Knowledgeable,
  the
Wise.”
33.
He said, “O Adam, tell them their names.”
And when he told them their names, He said,
“Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of
the  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  that  I  know
what you reveal and what you conceal?”
34.
And We said to the an
gels, “Bow down to
Adam.” They bowed down, except for Satan.
He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the
disbelievers.
35.
We  said,  “O  Adam,  inhabit  the  Garden,
you and your spouse, and eat from it freely as
you please, but do not approach this tree, lest
you become wrongdoers.”
36.
But Satan caused them to slip from it, and
caused them to depart the state they were in.
We said, “Go down, some of you enemies of
one another. And you will have residence on
earth, and enjoyment for a while.”
37.
Then Adam rec
eived words from his Lord,
so He relented towards him. He is the Relent-
ing, the Merciful.
38.
We said, “Go down from it, all of you. Yet
whenever  guidance  comes  to  you  from  Me,
then   whoever   follows   My   guidance
—
they
have nothing to fear, nor shall they gri
eve.
39.
But  as  for  those  who  disbelieve  and  reject
Our   signs
—
these   are   the   inmates   of   the
Fire—
wherein they will remain forever.”
40.
O Children of Israel! Remember My bless-
ings  which  I  bestowed  upon  you,  and  fulfill
your pledge to Me, and I will fulfill My pledge
to you, and fear Me.
41.
And believe in what I revealed, confirming
what  is  with  you;  and  do  not  be  the  first  to
2
2.
THE HEIFER
  (al
-Baqarah)
deny it; and do not exchange My revelations
for a small price; and be conscious of Me.
42.
And do not mix truth with falsehood, and
do not conceal the truth while you know.
43.
And  attend  to  your  prayers,  and  practice
regular  charity,  and  kneel  with  those  who
kneel.
44.
Do you command people to virtuous con-
duct, and forget yourselves, even though you
read the Scripture? Do you not under
stand?
45.
And   seek   help   through   patience   and
prayer.  But  it  is  difficult,  except  for  the  de-
vout.
46.
Those who know that they will meet their
Lord, and that to Him they will return.
47.
O Children of Israel! Remember My favor
which  I  bestowed  upon  you,
and  I  that  fa-
vored you over all nations.
48.
And  beware  of  a  Day  when  no  soul  will
avail another in the least, nor will any inter-
cession be accepted on its behalf, nor will any
ransom  be  taken  from  it,  nor  will  they  be
helped.
49.
And recall that We delive
red you from the
people of Pharaoh. They inflicted on you ter-
rible persecution, killing your sons and spar-
ing your women. Therein was a tremendous
trial from your Lord.
50.
And recall that We parted the sea for you,
so We saved you, and We drowned the peo-
ple of Pharaoh as you looked on.
51.
And  recall  that  We  appointed  for  Moses
forty nights. Then you took to worshiping the
calf after him, and you turned wicked.
52.
Then We pardoned you after that, so that
you might be grateful.
53.
And recall that We gave Moses the Scrip-
ture  and  the  Criterion,  so  that  you  may  be
guided.
54.
And recall that Moses said to his people, “O
my  people,  you  have  done  wrong  to  your-
selves  by  worshiping  the  calf.  So  repent  to
your  Maker,  and  kill  your  egos.  That  would
be  better  for  yo
u  with  your  Maker.”  So  He
turned  to  you  in  repentance.  He  is  the  Ac-
cepter of Repentance, the Merciful.
55.
And recall that you said, “O Moses, we will
not   believe   in   you   unless   we   see   Allah
plainly.”  Thereupon  the  thunderbolt  struck
you, as you looked on.
56.
Then We revived you after your death, so
that you may be appreciative.
57.
And We shaded you with clouds, and We
sent down to you manna and quails: “Eat of
the good things We have provided for you.”
They  did  not  wrong  Us,  but  they  used  to
wrong their own souls.
58.
And recall that We said, “Enter this town,
and eat plentifully from it whatever you wish;
but enter the gate humbly, and say, 'Pardon.'
We will forgive your sins, and give increase to
the virtuous.”
59.
But  the  wrongdoers  among  them  substi-
tut
ed words other than those given to them,
so We sent down on the wrongdoers a plague
from heaven, because of their wicked behav-
ior.
60.
And  recall  when  Moses  prayed  for  water
for his people. We said, “Strike the rock with
your staff.” Thereupon twelve sprin
gs gushed
out  from  it,  and  each  tribe  recognized  its
drinking
-place.  “Eat  and  drink  from  Allah’s
provision, and do not corrupt the earth with
disobedience.”
61.
And  recall  when  you  said,  “O  Moses,  we
cannot  endure  one  kind  of  food,  so  call  to
your Lord to
produce for us of what the earth
grows: of its herbs, and its cucumbers, and its
garlic, and its lentils, and its onions.” He said,
“Would  you  substitute  worse  for  better?  Go
down to Egypt, where you will have what you
asked  for.”  They  were  struck  with  hum
ilia-
tion  and  poverty,  and  incurred  wrath  from
Allah. That was because they rejected Allah’s
revelations and wrongfully killed the proph-
ets.  That  was  because  they  disobeyed  and
transgressed.
62.
Those who believe, and those who are Jew-
ish, and the Christian
s, and the Sabeans
—
any
who  believe  in  Allah  and  the  Last  Day,  and
3
100.
THE RACERS
  (al
-’Adiyat)
5.
For your Lord will have inspired it.
6.
On  that  Day,  the  people  will  emerge  in
droves, to be shown their works.
7.
Whoever has done an atom's weight of good
wi
ll see it.
8.
And whoever has done an atom's weight of
evil will see it.
100.
 THE RACERS
(al-’Adiyat
)
In the name of Allah,
the Gracious, the Merciful
1.
By the racers panting.
2.
Igniting sparks.
3.
Raiding at dawn.
4.
Raising clouds of dust.
5.
Storming into the midst.
6.
Indeed, the human being is ungrateful to his
Lord.
7.
And he bears witness to that.
8.
And he is fierce in his love of wealth.
9.
Does  he  not  know?  When  the  contents  of
the graves are scattered around.
10.
And  the  contents  of  the  hearts  are  ob-
tained.
11.
Their Lord, on that Day, is fully informed
of them.

)
In the name of Allah,
the Gracious, the Merciful
1.
The Shocker.
2.
What is the Shocker?
3.
What will explain to you what the Shocker
is?
4.
The
Day when the people will be like scat-
tered moths.
5.
And the mountains will be like tufted wool.
6.
As for he whose scales are heavy.
7.
He will be in a pleasant life.
8.
But as for he whose scales are light.
9.
His home is the Abyss.
10.
Do you know what
it is?
11.
A Raging Fire.
102.
 ABUNDANCE
(at-Takathur
)
In the name of Allah,
the Gracious, the Merciful
1.
Abundance distracts you.
2.
Until you visit the graveyards.
3.
Indeed, you will know.
4.
Certainly, you will know.
5.
If you knew with knowledge
of certainty.
6.
You would see the Inferno.
7.
Then you will see it with the eye of certainty.
8.
Then,  on  that  Day,  you  will  be  questioned
about the Bliss.
103.
 TIME
(al-’Asr
)
In the name of Allah,
the Gracious, the Merciful
1.
By Time.

The human bei
ng is in loss.

Except  those  who  believe,  and  do  good
works, and encourage truth, and recommend
patience.
104.
 THE BACKBITER
(al-Humazah
)
In the name of Allah,
the Gracious, the Merciful
1.
Woe to every slanderer backbiter.
239
105.
THE ELEPHANT
   (al-Fil)
2.
Who gathers wealth and
counts it over.
3.
Thinking that his wealth has made him im-
mortal.
4.
By  no  means.  He  will  be  thrown  into  the
Crusher.
5.
And  what  will  make  you  realize  what  the
Crusher is?
6.
Allah's kindled Fire.
7.
That laps to the hearts.
8.
It closes in on them.
9.
In extended columns.
105.
 THE ELEPHANT
(al-Fil
)
In the name of Allah,
the Gracious, the Merciful
1.
Have  you  not  considered  how  your  Lord
dealt with the People of the Elephant?
2.
Did He not make their plan go wrong?
3.
He sent against them swarms of bir
ds.
4.
Throwing at them rocks of baked clay.
5.
Leaving them like chewed
-up leaves.
106.
 QURAISH
(Quraysh
)
In the name of Allah,
the Gracious, the Merciful
1.
For the security of Quraish.
2.
Their  security  during  winter  and  summer
journeys.
3.
Let them w
orship the Lord of this House.
4.
Who has fed them against hunger, and has
secured them against fear.
107.
 ASSISTANCE
(al-Ma’un
)
In the name of Allah,
the Gracious, the Merciful
1.
Have  you  considered  him  who  denies  the
religion?
2.
It is he who mistreats the orphan.
3.
And does not encourage the feeding of the
poor.
4.
So woe to those who pray.
5.
Those who are heedless of their prayers.
6.
Those who put on the appearance.
7.
And withhold the assistance.
108.

(al-Kawthar
)

I do n
ot worship what you worship.
3.
Nor do you worship what I worship.
4.
Nor do I serve what you serve.
5.
Nor do you serve what I serve.

You have your way, and I have my way.”

In the name
of Alla h,
the Gracious, the Merciful

Condemned  are  the  hands  of  Abee  Lahab,
and he is condemned.

His wealth did not avail him, nor did what
he acquired.
3.
He will burn in a Flaming Fire.
4.
And his wife
—
the firewood carrier.
5.
Around her neck is a rope of thorns.
112

(al-Ikhlas )
In the name of Allah,

ers.

And from the evil of those who practice sor-
cery.

And  from
  the  evil  of  an  envious  when  he
envies.”

-Nas

From the evil of the sneaky whisperer.

Who
whispers into the hearts of people.
6.
From among jinn and among people.”
