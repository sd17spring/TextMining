                			[Cheery instrumental music] Mom, Dad, I found cigarettes in Greg's jacket.<br/> - Greg, were you smoking cigarettes? - No, Dad.<br/> He's lying.<br/> There's no doubt about that.<br/> Greg, I'm afraid your punishment will be four hours in the snakepit.<br/> That'll give you time to think about what you did.<br/> Man! That'll teach him.<br/> Jan, I'm afraid you've earned a day in the fire chamber for tattling on your brother.<br/> Smoking.<br/> How does a boy like that go so wrong? - They live in a crummy neighborhood.<br/> - The Bradys? Yeah.<br/> They got robbers, thugs, drug dealers.<br/> You name it.<br/> You folks want some pancakes? PETER: No, thanks.<br/> See, that's the worst we got is Jemima's Witnesses.<br/> LOIS: [Singing] "It seems today that all you see "is violence in movies and sex on TV "But where are those good, old-fashioned values "on which we used to rely? "Lucky there's a family guy "Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you "all the things that make us "laugh 'n' cry "He's a family guy" [Cheery instrumental music] MEG: Mom, my lips are too thin.<br/> Can I please get collagen injections? Meg, you don't need to change the way you look.<br/> You know, most of the world's problems stem from poor self-image.<br/> [Polka music playing in gym] [Man and women laughing] [Growling] Excellent! The mind-control device is nearing completion! LOIS: Stewie, I said no toys at the table.<br/> Damn you, vile woman! You've impeded my work since the day I escaped from your wretched womb.<br/> Don't pout, honey.<br/> When you were born the doctor said you were the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen.<br/> But, of course.<br/> That was my victory day.<br/> The fruition of my deeply-laid plans to escape from that cursed ovarian bastille! Return the device, woman! No toys, Stewie.<br/> Very well, then.<br/> Mark my words, when you least expect it, your uppance will come! [Suspenseful instrumental music] Mom, can I turn the heat up? Don't touch the thermostat, Meg.<br/> Your father gets upset.<br/> Come on.<br/> This thing goes up to 90.<br/> Who touched the thermostat? God, how does he always know? Brain implant, Meg.<br/> Every father's got one.<br/> Tells you when the kids mess with the dial.<br/> GUY: My thing went off! Your thermostat okay? - Yeah, it's all right.<br/> - Is my kid over here? Forget it! False alarm! BRIAN: Ass ahoy.<br/> Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on.<br/> What's the occasion? He's going to a stag party.<br/> Lois, I work hard all week to provide for this family.<br/> I am the man of the house.<br/> As the man, I order you to give me permission to go to this party.<br/> Look, at least promise me you won't drink.<br/> Alcohol always leads to trouble.<br/> Come on.<br/> You're worrying about nothing.<br/> Remember when you got drunk off the Communion wine at church? And so the Lord God smote poor Job with festering boils all over his body.<br/> Man, I hate it when he tells this story.<br/> PRIEST: Yet, miraculously, Job was still able to retain his dignity.<br/> - Is that really the blood of Christ? - Yes.<br/> Man, that guy must've been wasted And then there was that time at the ice cream store.<br/> Butter Rum's my favorite.<br/> Remember you had an Irish coffee the day we went to see Philadelphia? [Audience crying] I got it.<br/> That's the guy from Big.<br/> Tom Hanks, that's it.<br/> Funny guy, Tom Hanks.<br/> Everything he says is a stitch.<br/> I have AIDS.<br/> - Promise me, Peter.<br/> - Lois, honey, I promise.<br/> Not a drop of alcohol is gonna touch these lips tonight.<br/> Who wants to play Drink The Beer? Right here.<br/> - You win.<br/> - All right.<br/> What do I win? Another beer! I'm going for the high score! Actually, Charlie's got the high score.<br/> Man.<br/> Your clock won't flush.<br/> I feel kind of bad, guys.<br/> I promised my wife I wouldn't drink.<br/> - Don't feel bad, Peter.<br/> - Gee.<br/> I never thought of it like that.<br/> Did you bring the porno? Did I bring the porno? You're gonna love it.<br/> It's a classic.<br/> Listen, Ilsa.<br/> If I take this thing out and you're not on it, you'll regret it.<br/> Not today or tomorrow.<br/> RICK: But soon, and for the rest of your life.<br/> Come on, llsa! Get on it! [Funky music on TV] NARRATOR: The statue was a gift from France.<br/> What is this? Man.<br/> My kid must've taped over this for history class.<br/> [Groans] The Statue of Liberty? What are we gonna do? - Boys, we're gonna drink till she's hot.<br/> - That's just crazy enough to work.<br/> Meg, finish your pancakes.<br/> - Chris, elbows off your father.<br/> - Thanks, son.<br/> a great example for the kids, Peter.<br/> Yeah.<br/> A new family record.<br/> Way to raise the bar, Dad.<br/> Chris, you're 13.<br/> Don't talk like that.<br/> Kids, Daddy only drank so the Statue of Liberty would take her clothes off.<br/> - What did you promise me last night? - I wouldn't drink at the stag party.<br/> - And what did you do? - Drank at the stag I almost walked right into that one.<br/> God! Feels like accountants are cranking adding machines in my head.<br/> [Machines whirring] Dick, you ever wonder what's outside those walls? That's dangerous thinking, Paul.<br/> You best stick to your work.<br/> Okay.<br/> You see? A hangover is nature's way of telling you I was right.<br/> I mean MEG: Mom, are you all right? LOIS: My goodness.<br/> This chair leg was loose.<br/> Isn't that silly? I could've broken my neck.<br/> Damn! [Suspenseful instrumental music] Honey.<br/> I took a cab home, I slept on the table so I wouldn't wake you up.<br/> Nothing bad happened.<br/> I guess you're right.<br/> Apology accepted.<br/> All right, I'm going to work.<br/> Somebody's gotta put food on this table.<br/> How are you coming, Johnson? Mr.<br/> Weed, I've been working on the new G.<br/>I.<br/> Jew line.<br/> And as you can see, they look great.<br/> You call these bagels? I'm glad he's on our side! [Snoring] MR.<br/> WEED: Peter! PETER: What? Are you sleeping on the job? No.<br/> There's a bug in my eye and I'm trying to suffocate him.<br/> Peter, I like you.<br/> But I need you to be more than just eye candy around here.<br/> It's your job to watch for toys that could be hazardous to kids.<br/> - Now, look sharp! - Yes, sir! [Snoring] [Foreboding instrumental music] And now back to Action News 5.<br/> Our top story tonight, "When Toys Attack.<br/>" Quite a situation we've got here, Tom.<br/> Quite a situation we've got here, Tom, indeed, Diane.<br/> The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Company of Quahog, Rhode Island has released highly unsafe products into the retail market.<br/> Come on, Timmy! Throw the Silly Ball! Boy! A Pound Poochie! Come on, Baby Heimlich, spit it out.<br/> Peter, I'm appalled.<br/> Your negligence has damaged this company's reputation.<br/> You're fired! Jeez.<br/> For how long? [Sad instrumental music] My God! You got fired? - Way to go, Dad! Fight the machine! - How do you know about the machine? PETER: Don't worry.<br/> I'll still put food on this table.<br/> Just not as much.<br/> So it might get a little competitive.<br/> Who cares about food? Now we'll never be able to afford my lip injections! BRIAN: Can we put her out in the yard for a while? LOIS: Okay, who's hungry? Jeez.<br/> How the hell am I gonna break this to Lois? If she finds out I got fired for drinking, she's gonna blame me! DEVIL: Lie to her.<br/> It's okay to lie to women.<br/> They're not people like us.<br/> I don't know.<br/> Hey, where's the other guy? [Cars honking] Come on, you bastard! I'm late for work.<br/> This is perfect! Look, I don't want your mom to worry, all right? When she worries, she says, "I told you so" and: "Stop doing that.<br/> I'm asleep.<br/>" So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay? Not a word to your mom about me getting canned.<br/> LOIS: What's that, Peter? - Nothing.<br/> The lost-my-job smells great.<br/> - What? Meg, honey, can you pass the fired-my-ass-for-negligence? LOIS: Peter, are you feeling okay? I feel great! I haven't got a job in the world.<br/> All right, then let's eat.<br/> I know you all hate eggplant, but What on earth was that? What the deuce are you staring at? It's tuna fish and nothing else.<br/> [Suspenseful instrumental music] How's your job search going? It sucks, Brian.<br/> I've already been through two jobs this week.<br/> I got fired off of that commercial.<br/> DIRECTOR: Try it again.<br/> PETER: "I'm caca for Cocoa Puffs.<br/>" DIRECTOR: No, damn it! Take 26! Then I had that job as the sneeze guard for that restaurant's salad bar.<br/> Take it outside, lady.<br/> I thought I could win money in that talent show.<br/> EMCEE: And the prize goes to The von Trapp Family Singers! That is bull [Loud applause] Peter, I know it's a dangerous precedent but you might want to tell Lois the truth.<br/> What? That I can't provide for my family? That she's always right? That I didn't stand up to a tank in Tiananmen Square? Screw this! I just came over to buy some fireworks! You can't keep lying to her about losing your job.<br/> Eventually, she'll find out where you're going every day.<br/> Yeah.<br/> [Bells and music on TV] Yeah, you're right.<br/> Okay, I'll tell her tonight.<br/> [Crickets chirping] [Suspenseful instrumental music] [Mellow instrumental music] Victory is mine! LOIS: I'll need the checkbook in the morning.<br/> I'm going to Stop 'N Shop for some sweet corn.<br/> You're spending money on food again? Lois, we just had dinner.<br/> I enjoyed it so much, I thought we'd eat again tomorrow.<br/> Since when are you so concerned about our food budget? I just Lois, this is really hard for me to say, but What is it, Peter? - You're getting kind of fat.<br/> - What? It's just It's not healthy.<br/> Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape three times a week.<br/> When was the last time you saw your toes? I thought you people were supposed to be jolly.<br/> Peter, what the hell is the matter with you? Honey, if there's something wrong, you can tell me.<br/> - Sorry, man.<br/> Am I late? What did I miss? - Thank God you're here.<br/> What do I do? Tell him to keep quiet.<br/> He's in too deep.<br/> I don't know.<br/> Where's the other guy? [Cars honking] This is unbelievable! I promise you, everything's fine.<br/> You got nothing to worry about.<br/> STEWIE: Well, well, Mother! We meet again! Stewie, I thought I tucked you in an hour ago.<br/> Not tightly enough it would seem.<br/> And now you contemptible harpy I shall end your reign of matriarchal tyranny.<br/> LOIS: You can play tomorrow, honey.<br/> Right now it's bedtime.<br/> Blast you and your estrogenical treachery! PETER: Sweet dreams, kiddo.<br/> You have the power to end this! How'd she take it? I told her she was fat.<br/> No.<br/> I hate lying to Lois.<br/> It's just It's the best way to keep her from the truth.<br/> You have no choice.<br/> Your unemployment will dry up soon.<br/> She'll probably sense something's amiss when they repossess your house.<br/> You really oughta think of your family's welfare.<br/> Jeez, Brian! That's a great idea! Okay, do you have any disabilities, past injuries, physical anomalies? I didn't have gas for the first time until I was 30.<br/> [Breaks wind] What the hell was that? PETER: Guys, our money problems are over! We're officially on welfare.<br/> Come on, help me scatter car parts on the front lawn.<br/> How much are we getting? Let's see.<br/> $150 a week.<br/> Wait.<br/> That's a comma, not a decimal.<br/> [Uplifting instrumental music] Whoops.<br/> No, I haven't seen Peter all afternoon.<br/> I was giving a piano lesson.<br/> Stewie, why don't you play in the other room? Why don't you burn in hell? No dessert for you, young man.<br/> Who would've thought getting drunk would get me $150,000 a week from the government? This is why I don't vote.<br/> Maybe somebody down there was drinking, too.<br/> Mr.<br/> President, why do you think the public supports you during these impeachment proceedings? Probably because you're so fat.<br/> Peter, you might want to call the Welfare Commission.<br/> That check is obviously an oversight.<br/> Not necessarily.<br/> Maybe I'm like their one millionth customer.<br/> BRIAN: What? You're gonna spend $150,000 a week? - Yeah.<br/> - On what? LOIS: Oh, my God! Peter, you bought the statue of David? No.<br/> I just rented it.<br/> But they're gonna be ticked.<br/> The penis broke off while I was loading it into the car.<br/> I shall call you "Eduardo.<br/>" Peter, how can we afford this? You won't believe it, Mom! Dad's getting A big raise! Peter, that's wonderful! But, Dad, I thought The kind of raise that'll allow me to give my kids a big allowance just for keeping their big mouths shut.<br/> Come on, guys.<br/> I'll buy us the most expensive meal we've ever had.<br/> Yeah.<br/> I'd like 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas, please.<br/> CLERK: I beg your pardon? And a "So-sage" McBiscuit, please.<br/> Peter, what's the big surprise? You know how I always said you should be treated like a queen? I got you your own jester.<br/> JESTER: Good to be here in New England.<br/> And what's the deal with "New" England anyway? It's over 200 years old! Last time I checked, that's not that new.<br/> This is great.<br/> I can finally afford to give my little girl the lips she's always dreamed of.<br/> MEG: Thank you, Daddy! [Kisses Peter] I don't know, Peter.<br/> Lips are one thing.<br/> But did you have to buy breast implants for Chris? It makes him happy.<br/> These are cool.<br/> MAILWOMAN: When did you get a pool? It's a moat.<br/> I know it's silly but my husband thinks our family needs extra protection now that we're rich.<br/> Does it work? It does keep the Black Knight at bay.<br/> [Horse sputtering] Congratulations in all your success.<br/> Here's your welfare check.<br/> What the [Foghorn blowing] Hi, honey.<br/> What? PETER: I know what I did was wrong.<br/> But I only did it for you and the kids.<br/> Except for the jukebox in the bathroom.<br/> That was for Peter.<br/> Yeah, from the American taxpayers.<br/> I am so mad I can't see straight.<br/> No problem.<br/> We got money to get that fixed with enough left for us to buy our way out of any trouble our kids might get into.<br/> Just like the Kennedys.<br/> LOIS: I feel like I don't even know you anymore, Peter.<br/> The man I married would never think he could fix a problem just by spending money! Boy, she's pretty pissed.<br/> Who thought fraud would be one of her buttons? Why have a jukebox in the john if your wife's mad at you? Peter, you may have to return that money to the taxpayers.<br/> But I gotta make sure Lois knows I'm doing it.<br/> I need an event with thousands of people.<br/> Something that everybody cares about.<br/> We might have to leave Rhode Island for this.<br/> ANNOUNCER: The air is electric here at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight! Pat, it's safe to say that all these fans came out here to watch a game of football! John, we're in commercial.<br/> Yeah, I know.<br/> I'm just making conversation.<br/> Come on.<br/> Football! Amazing.<br/> You can barely drive a car.<br/> Yet you were allowed to fly a blimp? Yeah, America's great, isn't it? Except for the South.<br/> Boy, I hope Lois is watching.<br/> Okay, taxpayers, here you go! PAT: Looks like we're getting some rain here tonight, John.<br/> Yeah.<br/> Hey, wait a second! This is no ordinary rain! It's some kind of crazy money rain! I'm being told it's a man and his dog throwing cash out of a blimp.<br/> Man.<br/> I hope this works.<br/> Otherwise, I'm gonna have to start dropping these.<br/> [People cheering] JOHN: The crowd is storming the field! This is pandemonium! Have you ever seen anything like this, Pat? Just once.<br/> The 1975 Cotton Bowl.<br/> This is the old "trying to make amends "for spending $150,000 a week in misappropriated welfare funds" play.<br/> I don't care what it is! That guy's ruining a perfectly good game of football! - Madden to Fox Security.<br/> - Go ahead.<br/> JOHN: Take them down! GUARD: Yes, sir.<br/> How was your shower? I tell you, all of the rumors about dropping the soap are true.<br/> Really? You can't hold onto that thing to save your life.<br/> It was slipping everywhere.<br/> Guys were laughing.<br/> GUY: There's the guy that couldn't hold the soap.<br/> That was classic.<br/> Boy.<br/> I really let Lois down this time.<br/> Do you think she'll wait for me? If every woman dumped her husband for crashing a blimp, no one would be married.<br/> Yeah, you're right.<br/> Okay, I got the top bunk.<br/> My collagen is wearing off.<br/> Honey, sagging lips are just nature's way of telling you you shouldn't cover for your father's lie.<br/> What does it mean when your armpits cry stinky tears? It means you're becoming a man.<br/> But hopefully not the kind who stays out all day and doesn't call like your father who shall remain nameless.<br/> STEWIE: Hello, Mother.<br/> LOIS: Hi there, sweetie.<br/> You know, Mother, life is like a box of chocolates.<br/> You never know what you're going to get.<br/> Your life, however, is more like a box of active grenades! [Dramatic instrumental music] STEWIE: Now, I offer one last chance for deliverance.<br/> Return my mind-control device or be destroyed.<br/> You just want your toy back.<br/> Okay, here you go, honey.<br/> Yes Well, victory is mine! [Explosion] STEWIE: Damn you all! [Phone ringing] [Phone ringing] Hello? Oh, my God! Lois, am I glad to see you.<br/> I have nothing to say to you, Peter.<br/> I gave the money back.<br/> Why are you still steamed? Peter, you lied to me, you betrayed my trust.<br/> Compared to that, welfare fraud doesn't even matter.<br/> Really? Let's hope the judge feels that way.<br/> This court will come to order.<br/> I figured the sooner I cashed the check the sooner they'd catch their mistake.<br/> Why are we making a federal case out of this? Don't you think you should have alerted the government of such a gross overpayment? I was gonna call them.<br/> But my favorite episode of Different Strokes was on.<br/> The one where Arnold and Dudley get sexually molested by the bike shop owner? All right.<br/> Now I want you boys to scream real loud at my ass.<br/> And everybody learns a valuable lesson.<br/> Mr.<br/> Griffin, have you learned a lesson? Yes.<br/> Stay the hell away from that bike shop.<br/> [People murmuring] Okay, everybody, I feel really bad about what I did.<br/> I just I don't know.<br/> I saw the one chance l'd ever have to give my family the things they deserve.<br/> I guess I screwed it up.<br/> I cheated the government.<br/> And worst of all, I lied to my wife.<br/> And she deserves better.<br/> I'm sorry, honey.<br/> Mr.<br/> Griffin, I think your words have touched us all.<br/> I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison.<br/> No! - No! - No! No! Yeah! [Rock music] [Rock music stops abruptly] LOIS: Excuse me, Your Honor? JUDGE: Yes? Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times.<br/> He may even be downright stupid.<br/> But I know he only accepted that money because he wanted to be a good husband and father.<br/> But what he needs to remember is that we love him.<br/> And no matter what, I'll always stand by him.<br/> I love you too, honey.<br/> That was very moving, Mrs.<br/> Griffin.<br/> Okay, you can go to jail with him! What? Intolerable as it may be l'm completely dependent upon those wretched drones for sustenance.<br/> Let us see how the constitution of American justice fares against the device! [Device pulsates] Is that your boy? What? Yeah.<br/> That's Stewie.<br/> Gosh.<br/> I can't separate a kid that young from his father.<br/> It's unjudgmenly.<br/> - Hell, you've learned your lesson, right? - Yeah.<br/> - All right.<br/> You're free.<br/> - Wow!
