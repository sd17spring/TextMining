Hark, and hear my tale, for heavy news to you I tell,
About the virtuous West Hall Table, of his reign and how he fell.

It was the twenty-second day of twenty-seventeen,
And West Hall 2 lay tranquil, innocent, serene.

But alas! All was not perfect, you could see in Daniel’s eyes
That his mind had wrought a wicket plot to cause Table’s demise.

Deliberately Daniel ascended West Hall stair;
He vaulted from the railing and he launched into the air;

In the lounge we saw it all, observed the Daniel’s leap and fall;
The Table void of all escape, the rest in awe to stare and gape;
But Daniel flew unhindered and with horror we had found,
That Daniel landed true, and Table crumbled to the ground.

With a pickaxe in his right hand and a chainsaw in his left,
He subjected our poor Table to the rage of Alhadeff.

Daniel hacked and desecrated much to our despair,
Cannons in the distance reverently fired in the air.

O, what offense did Table to provoke his wrath commit?
O, why must Table suffer the hand of this pile of poop?

Alas! The wooden structure had a wholesome life ahead,
But afore the brutal battle ceased our dear Table was dead.

In the streets the mourners wept, solemnly the sweepers swept;
The lovers loved, and laughed, and cried; the doers did, and lived, and died;
And Daniel stood undaunted as we bartered, tried to beg…
Into the night he stole, still clutching Table’s broken leg.
