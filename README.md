# Twitter Sentiment Analysis and Visualization
This program allows users to choose two twitter users and are given a graph of the resultant sentiment on a scale of -1 to 1. This scale is based off of [VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) which is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media, and works well on texts from other domains.
