# TextMining - EPL Twitter Sentiment Analysis


## Project Overview

This projects uses Twitter and Wikipedia as the data source for collecting the Tweets of all of the [English Premier League Players](https://twitter.com/BBCSport/lists/premier-league-players/members?lang=en), starting from 13 August, 2016 (First Day of Season) to 18 Feb, 2017. <br>
A [Sentiment analysis(NLTK)](http://www.nltk.org/howto/sentiment.html) of Tweets was conducted to find out if there exists any relationship between the current league standing and the result of the sentiment analysis of each club. <br>
> *<i>"Twitter is a Waste of Time"</i>, Sir Alex Ferguson, the Legendary Former Manchester United Manager*

Let's find out whether Sir Alex Ferguson was right or not!

## Key Components / Implementation Details

##### Two Main Components of Text_Mining.py
  * ##### Pickling Data from Twitter and Wikipedia <br>
    Data collected from these sources as pickles are :
    1. <u>*Twitter User Instances*</u> of members of <i>Premier League Twitter List</i>
    2. <u>*Twitter Status Instances*</u> from the Collected User Instances
    3. <u>*Tweet Texts*</u> from the Collected Status Instances
    4. <u>Current Clubs</u> of players from Wikipedia (BeautifulSoup)

  * ##### Sentiment Analysis of Tweets
    1. Sentimental Analysis(NLTK) with all Tweet Texts of an Individual Player
    2. Summation of the individual NLTK results to analyze individual Club Sentiment
    3. Displays EPL Clubs sorted by values of NLTK Sentiments.
       (compound, negative, neutral, positive)

##### Data Structures Used :
1. List is used to store User and Status Instances.
2. Dictionary using the names of the player as *keys* is implemented to store the followings as *values*:
    * Texts
    * Current Clubs
    * List of Individual NLTK Sentiments
    * List of Club NLTK Sentiments <br>

Lists were used because the Twitter Package returned most values in list of instances.<br>
Dictionaries are very useful with this project because all players and clubs have unique names that qualifies as keys. Searching(hashing) through a big set of data is way more efficient when implemented with a dictionary.


##### Design Choices :
1. I chose to take a SUM of all Sentiment Analysis results instead of taking an average of the values because I believe that frequency of Twitter usage does effect the overall result.
2. Although saving only the names of the Twitter instances of the players to different function is definetely more efficient considering memory usage, I chose to save all the instances of players in case I need to modify the codes later since these instances allow access to more diverse set of data.


## Results:

#### Here are some examples.

Looking at the comparison table, we notice a few interesting trends.

1. We observe that while there are some slight differences between different types of sentiments (compound, negative, neutral, positive), the pattern stays reasonably similar for these sentiments. This probably results from taking the sum of all individual values without considering the average.
2. We observe that the most frequently sentiment-wise top ranked club is Manchester United, but it's only ranked at #6 in the current league standing. While the dominant sentiment ranking for Manchester United might indicate that the ManU Players are the most active Twitters, it might also indicate that Sir Alex Ferguson was indeed right.
3. We observe that Chelsea, the top ranking team in current league standings, ranks only #5 for all the sentiment analysis. This might also indicate that Sir Alex Ferguson was indeed right
4. However, more carefully structured analysis needs to be conducted in order to acquire statistically trustworthy data. These trends are just for fun at the moment!


### Reflection

What went well with this project was that I successfully completed the anaylsis that I planned at the beginning of this project. Also the initial outline of the functions turned out to be quite accurate and useful, although I had to add some extra functions that I had not thought at the planning stage.<br>
What didn't go well is that it was difficult to create reasonable doctest strings for functions that deal with a collection of big data. Dealing with the pickled data made the unit testing process even more difficult. I ended up not writing any doctests because I didn't feel the necessity of making any after I was done with the project. I probably should've created docstrings incrementally as I worked on the project.<br>
What I learned from doing this project is that there are so many cool packages and APIs out there for python and that reading package documentations really help a lot when actually implementing the idea down with codes. Overall, this project taught me the joy of text mining!
