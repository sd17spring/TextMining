## Long German Words (lange deutsche WÃ¶rter)

## What it Does
To English speakers, very long German words often look silly.  This software
analyzes some of the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  It uses the texts
from Project Gutenberg (in German) to find the three longest words in each
of several of his works.

## How to Use It
Install pickle and requests libraries before using.  Run
"textmining_requests.py" to get the text files from Project Gutenberg.
Then, run "textmining_processing.py" to find the longest German words!
They will print in the terminal.

## Progress
This project was originally written in Week 6 of Software Design, and I
reworked it in Week 13.  It is now written in an object-oriented style and
has some updated text mining processes.
